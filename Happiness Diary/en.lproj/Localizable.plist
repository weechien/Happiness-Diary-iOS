		<string>Those who wake up each morning with work to accomplish and a mission to fulfill are the happiest people of all. SGI members are like this. For us each day is one of supreme purpose and satisfaction. For us each day is New Year&apos;s Day. Please exert yourselves vigorously with the determination to live each day to the fullest, so that you may compose a golden diary of life.</string>
		<string>The people are most important and noble. President Toda was firmly convinced of this point. And I have advanced with the same spirit. This is also Nichiren&apos;s undying spirit. Please always treasure and protect this organization of the people that is the SGI.</string>
		<string>Eiji Yoshikawa (1892–1962), the renowned Japanese author of many epic historic novels, asserted, &quot;Great character is forged through hardships.&quot; Surviving a life of hardships and difficulties, of stormy ups and downs, is what produces a person of great depth and character. True happiness is also found in such an unshakable state of life.</string>
		<string>Life is a series of changes, a succession of ups and downs. But those who possess a prime point, a home to which they can return no matter what happens, are strong. To come home to the world of friendship in the SGI, to talk things over and prepare for a fresh departure—this is the way I hope all of you will live. When you do, you will advance upon a fundamentally unerring path to happiness.</string>
		<string>Faith is light. The hearts of those with strong faith are filled with light. A radiance envelops their lives. People with unshakable conviction in faith enjoy a happiness that is as luminous as the full moon on a dark night, as dazzling as the sun on a clear day.</string>
		<string>Life for everyone is a struggle against the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness and death. Happiness is not the absence of problems or worries; it is to be undefeated no matter what problems or worries we may face. And this happiness is not solely focused on oneself. Truly happy are those who can help others become happy.</string>
		<string>When we plant the seed of happiness that is faith and carefully tend its growth, it will produce fruit without fail. We have to bear in mind, however, that we cannot plant a seed today and expect it to bear fruit tomorrow. That&apos;s not reasonable and Buddhism is reason. If we persevere in the practice of &quot;faith equals daily life&quot; in accord with reason, then our prayers will definitely be answered. This is Nichiren&apos;s promise to us. And his words are true beyond any doubt.</string>
		<string>Prayer is the foundation. But at the same time if we fail to make concrete efforts, no matter how much daimoku we chant, our prayers will not be answered. Buddhism is reason. If we just chant without doing any work we cannot succeed in our jobs.</string>
		<string>The real benefit of the Mystic Law is inconspicuous. Just as trees grow taller and stronger year after year, adding growth rings that are imperceptible to the human eye, we too will grow toward a victorious existence. For this reason it is important that we lead tenacious and balanced lives based on faith.</string>
		<string>Buddhism is reason. It is vital, therefore, that our lives and our activities in society also accord with reason. Please manifest the principle of &quot;faith equals daily life,&quot; so that you will be trusted, respected and emulated by others. Bringing fragrant flowers of trust and humanism to bloom throughout society is one of the goals of Buddhism. To do things that others find strange and unnatural, that run counter to common sense—such actions go against the basic tenets of Buddhism and amount to slander of the Law.</string>
		<string>The role of leaders is important. Everything is determined by the leaders&apos; behavior. There is a passage in The Romance of the Three Kingdoms that says only those who possess genuine wisdom and virtue win the highest regard from people. It all comes down to you. You have to polish and develop yourselves. Should there be a leader or leaders in faith whom you do not like, all you have to do is determine not to become like them. All you have to do is decide that you will become leaders who will make everyone feel comfortable and at ease.</string>
		<string>In a passage of the &quot;Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings,&quot; Nichiren observes, &quot;When you bow to a mirror, the reflected image bows back&quot; (Gosho Zenshu, p. 769). People who respect others are respected by others in turn. Those who are unstinting in their compassion and concern for others are also protected and supported by others. Our environment is essentially a reflection of ourselves.</string>
		<string>A life lived without purpose or value, the kind in which one doesn&apos;t know the reason why one was born, is joyless and lackluster. To just live, eat and die without any real sense of purpose surely represents a life pervaded by the world of Animality. On the other hand, to do, create or contribute something that benefits others, society and ourselves and to dedicate ourselves as long as we live up to that challenge—that is a life of true satisfaction, a life of value. It is a humanistic and lofty way to live.</string>
		<string>Everyone at some time suffers from illness in one form or another. The power of the Mystic Law enables us to bring forth strength to overcome the pain and suffering of sickness with courage and determination. Nichiren writes: &quot;Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is like the roar of a lion. What sickness can therefore be an obstacle?&quot; (MW-1, 119).</string>
		<string>Nichiren was utterly convinced we could change even the most dire and painful reality, including the danger of war, and, indeed, that it was imperative we do so. This conviction underlies his unwavering determination to create a peaceful society by widely disseminating the teachings of Buddhism.</string>
		<string>It is important to take a long-range view. No great achievement is accomplished overnight or without difficulty. Should benefit be obtained easily without making any efforts in Buddhist practice, we&apos;d probably just as easily abandon our faith and end up miserable as a consequence. Because it isn&apos;t easy to get into a highly ranked school, students study with all their might, gaining an abundance of knowledge and ability. Faith follows basically the same formula: Practice is essential to attaining Buddhahood.</string>
		<string>Please remember that patience is in and of itself a great challenge, and that it often holds the key to breaking through a seeming impasse.</string>
		<string>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who was a tireless crusader for human rights, said: &quot;Life&apos;s most persistent and urgent question is, What are you doing for others?&quot; Do not say you will do it &quot;someday&quot;; now is the time. Do not say &quot;someone&quot; will do it; you are the one. Now is the time for youth to take full responsibility and courageously pave the way for the people&apos;s triumph.</string>
		<string>By changing our inner state of mind, we can change any suffering or hardship into a source of joy, regarding it as a means for forging and developing our lives. To turn even sorrow into a source of creativity—this is the way of life of a Buddhist.</string>
		<string>Everyone born in this world has a unique role that only he or she can fulfill. Were this not the case, we would not be here. The universe never acts without cause; everything invariably has a reason for being. Even the weeds people love to loathe serve a purpose.</string>
		<string>Humanity today lacks hope and vision for the future. It is for precisely this reason that the Bodhisattvas of the Earth have appeared. Without your presence, the future of humanity would be bleak and spiritual decline its destination. That is why you have been born in this age and are now playing an active role in society. This is the meaning of jiyu, or &quot;emerging from the earth.&quot; Consequently, each of you will definitely become happy. Please be confident that you will lead lives overflowing with good fortune throughout the three existences of past, present and future.</string>
		<string>Ultimately, happiness rests on how you establish a solid sense of self or being. Happiness does not lie in outward appearances nor in vanity. It is a matter of what you feel inside; it is a deep resonance in your life. To be filled each day with a rewarding sense of exhilaration and purpose, a sense of tasks accomplished and deep fulfillment—people who feel this way are happy. Those who have this sense of satisfaction even if they are extremely busy are much happier than those who have time on their hands but feel empty inside.</string>
		<string>As practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism, we get up in the morning and do gongyo. Some perhaps may do so rather reluctantly! Nevertheless, doing gongyo is itself a truly great and noble thing. Gongyo is a solemn ceremony in which we are looking out and over the universe. It is a dialogue with the universe.</string>
		<string>We use our voices not only to chant daimoku but to guide, encourage and introduce others to Nichiren Buddhism. Our voice, therefore, is very important. An angry voice, a coarse voice, a cold voice, an imperious voice—none of these will communicate how wonderful Nichiren Buddhism is. I would like you to be humanistic leaders who can encourage others with bright warm voices, so that they will say, &quot;What a lovely voice!&quot; and &quot;I&apos;m always so inspired when I hear you speak.&quot; Becoming this kind of leader is one actual proof of your human revolution.</string>
		<string>The important thing is to hold on resolutely to one&apos;s convictions come what may, just as Nichiren teaches. People who possess such unwavering conviction will definitely become happy.</string>
		<string>Truly praiseworthy are those who resolve to work hard for kosen-rufu and the SGI within the lofty realm of Nichiren Buddhism. They are genuinely capable people. And they will definitely attain life-conditions of complete fulfillment.</string>
		<string>Viewing events and situations in a positive light is important. The strength, wisdom and cheerfulness that accompany such an attitude lead to happiness. To regard everything in a positive light or with a spirit of goodwill, however, does not mean being foolishly gullible and allowing people to take advantage of our good nature. It means having the wisdom and perception to actually move things in a positive direction by seeing things in their best light, while all the time keeping our eyes firmly focused on reality.</string>
		<string>All of you are chanting for the happiness of many members—children of the Buddha—in your respective communities; you support and encourage them and work tirelessly on their behalf as if they were your own children. Your actions are truly those of great bodhisattvas; your state of life that of noble Buddhas.</string>
		<string>Practicing Buddhism means being victorious. In advancing one step at a time amid the realities of our daily lives, in showing concrete actual proof, in becoming victors and successes, we are demonstrating with our very beings the validity of Nichiren Buddhism and serving as a source of hope and inspiration for those who will follow us on the path of faith.</string>
		<string>Buddhism teaches that &quot;all phenomena in the universe are manifestations of the Law&quot; (Gosho Zenshu, p. 564). I hope you will, with this understanding, engage in broad-ranging studies with vigor and determination. The brain has a potential as vast and boundless as the universe. How then do we manifest the brain&apos;s full creative powers? There is only one way to bring out our full intellectual capacity: by constantly putting our minds to work.</string>
		<string>Youth should not seek an easy comfortable path. No one develops in a pampered environment. Youth should instead actively seek out challenges and hardships, transforming them all into valuable assets as they strive to become individuals of outstanding character and ability.</string>
		<string>Buddhism teaches that one characteristic of a bodhisattva is being able to perceive the world&apos;s sounds. The insight needed to correctly discern and grasp developments in society and the times—even to anticipate them before they happen—is indispensable.</string>
		<string>Because life is long, you should not be impatient. What matters most is that you embrace the Gohonzon throughout your life. It is vitally important to continually challenge yourself to chant even a little more daimoku and to pray before the Gohonzon for the fulfillment of your desires.</string>
		<string>I can declare with confidence that each of you who bravely exerts yourself in doing Gakkai activities and taking leadership for kosen-rufu, calmly overcoming every obstacle along the way, will enjoy immeasurable benefit. I can state with certitude too that each of you is in perfect accord with Nichiren&apos;s spirit. Your efforts win his unrestrained applause and approval.</string>
		<string>Please never turn your back on your faith. Courage is crucial. There is no room for faintheartedness in faith. The timid doom themselves to ridicule—from their partners, from their children, from their friends, from the world at large. Nichiren declares that there is no place for cowards among his disciples. President Toda said the same.</string>
		<string>I hope that you will always speak the truth boldly, saying what needs to be said no matter whom you&apos;re addressing. When it comes to championing a just cause, you must never be cowardly, never fawn, never try to curry favor.</string>
		<string>Unless we live fully right now, not sometime in the future, true fulfillment in life will forever elude us. Rather than putting things off till the future, we should find meaning in life, thinking and doing what is most important right now, right where we are—setting our hearts aflame and igniting our lives. Otherwise, we cannot lead an inspired existence.</string>
		<string>Your environment does not matter. Everything starts with you. You must forge yourself through your own efforts. I urge each of you to create something, start something and make a success of something. That is the essence of human existence, the challenge of youth. Herein lies a wonderful way of life always aiming for the future.</string>
		<string>I hope that as leaders you will always express your appreciation for and do your utmost to support the many sincere members who are steadfastly exerting themselves in faith. Nichiren says that when you see someone who embraces the Mystic Law, you should rise and greet them from afar, showing them the same respect you would a Buddha.</string>
		<string>When we interact with others with true sincerity, the other person will more often than not come to respect and value our own character. And this is all the more so when our actions are based on prayer. Conversely, holding others in contempt only leads to being held in contempt oneself: one whose life is tainted by feelings of hate toward others will come to be reviled by others. Let us open the path to mutual respect and harmonious coexistence so as to bring an end to this vicious circle that has long been part of human destiny.</string>
		<string>We are all human beings, whatever our positions. If we open our hearts and speak with sincerity, we can communicate and touch others on the deepest level. World peace starts with trust between one individual and another.</string>
		<string>The moment we resolve &quot;I will become healthy!&quot; &quot;I will become strong!&quot; &quot;I will work cheerfully for kosen-rufu!&quot; our lives begin to move in that direction. We have to make up our minds.</string>
		<string>The important thing is to hold firm to your beliefs without being influenced or swayed by what others do or say. Those who live this way are strong and free of regret. What matters most is how you lead your life—not what those around you are doing.</string>
		<string>Remembering things about a person is an expression of compassion and concern. Forgetfulness shows a lack of compassion, a lack of responsibility.</string>
		<string>Strength is happiness. Strength is itself victory. In weakness and cowardice there is no happiness. When you wage a struggle, you might win or you might lose. But regardless of the short-term outcome, the very fact of your continuing to struggle is proof of your victory as a human being. A strong spirit, strong faith and strong prayer—developing these is victory and the world of Buddhahood.</string>
		<string>Life is full of unexpected suffering. Even so, as Eleanor Roosevelt said: &quot;If you can live through that [a difficult situation] you can live through anything. You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, &apos;I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.&apos;&quot; That&apos;s exactly right. Struggling against great difficulty enables us to develop ourselves tremendously. We can call forth and manifest those abilities lying dormant within us. Difficulty can be a source of dynamic growth and positive progress.</string>
		<string>I hope you will always live in unity with Nichiren, pursuing faith as disciples who are &quot;of the same mind as Nichiren.&quot; Unfazed by the petty jealousies of others, please move forward boldly with joy and laughter.</string>
		<string>Life contains the capacity, like flames that reach toward heaven, to transform suffering and pain into the energy needed for value-creation, into light that illuminates darkness. Like the wind traversing vast spaces unhindered, life has the power to uproot and overturn all obstacles and difficulties. Like clear flowing water, it can wash away all stains and impurities. And finally, life, like the great earth that sustains vegetation, impartially protects all people with its compassionate, nurturing force.</string>
		<string>Religious strife must be avoided at all cost; under no circumstance should it be allowed. People may hold different religious beliefs, but the bottom line is that we are all human beings. We all seek happiness and desire peace. Religion should bring people together. It should unite the potential for good in people&apos;s hearts toward benefiting society and humanity and creating a better future.</string>
		<string>This lifetime will never come again; it is precious and irreplaceable. To live without regret, it is crucial for us to have a concrete purpose and continually set goals and challenges for ourselves. It is equally important that we keep moving toward specific targets steadily and tenaciously, one step at a time.</string>
		<string>In his later years, President Toda often told his disciples: &quot;Be courageous in faith! No matter what other people may say, advance boldly! Lead confident lives! Make courage the Gakkai&apos;s eternal emblem!&quot; This was the spirit with which he charged us before he died. Faith is the source of true strength and courage. Without courage and confidence we cannot be said to have genuine faith.</string>
		<string>Friendship is strong. Friendship, camaraderie and unity in faith lie at the heart of the SGI. They come before the organization. We must never make the mistake of thinking that it is the other way around. The organization serves as a means for deepening friendship, comradeship and faith. To confuse the means and the end is a terrible mistake.</string>
		<string>What was the secret to Edison&apos;s success? He explained that it was to never give up before he succeeded in what he was trying to do. Not giving up—that&apos;s the only way. Once you give up you are defeated. This is equally true in the realm of faith. Quitting is not faith. We have to keep chanting until our prayers are answered. That is the correct way of prayer.</string>
		<string>Live in a way that is full of life—for yourself, for your loved ones, for your friends. People who do so will find the courage to transform sufferings into hopes. Not only that, but they will be able to light the lamp of hope in the hearts of many others as well.</string>
		<string>In a relationship, it is demeaning to constantly seek your partner&apos;s approval. Such relationships are bereft of real caring, depth or even love. For those of you who find yourselves in relationships where you are not treated the way your heart says you should be, I hope you will have the courage and dignity to decide that you are better off risking the scorn of your partner than enduring unhappiness with him or her.</string>
		<string>Gandhi taught people to live with lionlike courage, impressing upon them that they could not afford to leave things up to others, that they had to stand up for themselves and fight for justice. Ultimately, the only way forward is by developing self-reliance, forging a stand-alone spirit. That is the only path to victory.</string>
		<string>Buddhism teaches that life at each moment embraces all phenomena. This is the doctrine of a life-moment possessing three thousand realms, which is the Lotus Sutra&apos;s ultimate teaching and Buddhism&apos;s essence. Because of the profound way our lives interact with people around us, it is vital that we reach out to others, that we be engaged with our environment and with our local community. A self-absorbed practice or theory without action is definitely not Buddhism.</string>
		<string>Originally, every person&apos;s life is a brilliantly shining mirror. Differences arise depending on whether one polishes this mirror: A polished mirror is the Buddha&apos;s life, whereas a tarnished mirror is that of a common mortal. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is what polishes our lives.</string>
		<string>You can forge the path to a fulfilling and enjoyable life if you have the depth of faith to regard everything as a source for creating happiness and value. Conversely, if you see everything only in a negative or pessimistic light, your life will gradually but inevitably be plunged into darkness. Buddhism teaches the subtle principle of ichinen and, moreover, the power of faith.</string>
		<string>A great human revolution in just a single individual will help achieve a change in the destiny of a nation and, further, will enable a change in the destiny of all humankind.</string>
		<string>We need to go out and mix with people every day. Making our local community the base for our activities, we need to forge ties of friendship with others and work with them to create peace. Staying connected in this way to our town, city, state and country is a practical manifestation of our lives permeating all things.</string>
		<string>There is a saying, &quot;To start an undertaking is easy; to maintain it is difficult.&quot; Though creating something new may seem daunting, it is in fact easy when compared to the far more challenging task of carrying on an existing enterprise, to keep it going, to develop it further. Everything depends on people, on capable successors. And our movement for kosen-rufu depends on young people. For that reason I am determined to do all that I can right now to raise genuine successors in the youth division.</string>
		<string>According to Buddhism, health is not a condition in which we merely escape negative influences. It is a highly positive, active state in which we hold ourselves responsible for such influences, in which we face and try to solve various problems—not just our own but others&apos; problems, too. The word disease implies a lack of ease, which conversely implies that health is a state of comfort. In the Buddhist sense, however, being &quot;at ease&quot; does not mean freedom from difficulties; it means having the strength to meet and overcome any problem.</string>
		<string>Life is about scaling one mountain, then facing the next one, followed by the one after that. Those who persevere and finally succeed in conquering the highest mountain are victors in life. On the other hand, those who avoid such challenges and take the easy route, descending into the valleys, will end in defeat.</string>
		<string>The efforts made by one individual can be immensely important. Nichiren repeatedly states that victory depends not on numbers but on a group or individual&apos;s attitude or resolve. In one passage he writes: &quot;Everyone in Japan, from the sovereign on down to the common people, all without exception tried to do me harm, but I have survived until this day. This is because, although I am alone, I have firm faith [in the Lotus Sutra]&quot; (MW-3, 198). In other words, his strong faith enabled him to emerge triumphant. I find this passage deeply moving.</string>
		<string>There is no need for you to be impatient. If you can achieve something very easily right from the start, you will find no sense of fulfillment or joy. It is in making tenacious, all-out efforts for construction that profound happiness lies.</string>
		<string>When you hold fast to your beliefs and live true to yourself, your true value as a human being shines through. Buddhism teaches the concept of &quot;realizing your inherent potential.&quot; In other words manifesting your true entity, your innate self, revealing it and bringing it to shine, illuminating all around you. It refers to your most refined individuality and uniqueness.</string>
		<string>The great French philosopher Jean–Jacques Rousseau (1712–78) wrote in his work Emile: &quot;There is no happiness without courage nor virtue without struggle.&quot; Without courage there is no happiness and it is impossible to create a life of value. This is an unchanging rule of human existence.</string>
		<string>The fundamental spirit of Buddhism is that all people are equal. A person is not great simply because of his or her social standing, fame, academic background or position in the organization. In the world of faith, the truly great are those who spread the Mystic Law and strive for kosen-rufu, who actively work for the sake of Buddhism and the happiness of others. Supremely respectworthy are those who champion the cause of kosen-rufu.</string>
		<string>Where is happiness to be found? The famous Roman philosopher–emperor Marcus Aurelius (121–80) said, &quot;A man&apos;s true delight is to do the things he was made for.&quot; Human happiness, he maintained, lies in doing those things only humans can: seeking the truth and acting to help those who are suffering. Goethe, too, asserted that those who work cheerfully and take joy in the fruits of their labor are truly happy. These are the words of great thinkers, and as you can see they are in complete accord with the teachings of Buddhism.</string>
		<string>All right, let&apos;s get to work again!—This is the spirit of people of genuine substance. Those who avoid hard work or neglect the things they have to do, who just while away their time, eating, sleeping, playing, watching television—such individuals will never experience true happiness, satisfaction or joy.</string>
		<string>As SGI members our work, our mission, is clear. We have the unparalleled task of working for the happiness of all humanity in an endeavor we call kosen-rufu. To participate in SGI activities and challenge ourselves earnestly on the path of our mission are the greatest happiness. It all comes down to whether we can appreciate this point.</string>
		<string>If we don&apos;t practice gongyo, the rhythm of our lives will be thrown off kilter, just as a machine that isn&apos;t oiled will rust. Gongyo and chanting daimoku are like starting an automobile&apos;s engine every day and driving in the direction of happiness and truth. By doing so day after day, you will gradually attain perfect unity with the universe and the Law. That state is the state of the Buddha.</string>
		<string>As SGI leaders, how we interpret the words of members and what we say in response are important. A genuine leader is someone who gives measured thought to such matters. When talking with individuals, ask yourselves: &quot;What are they worried about?&quot; &quot;What are they trying to say?&quot; &quot;What are they thinking?&quot; &quot;What is it they seek?&quot; Try to discern these things in others. Try to know. Try to understand. This is the challenge of leadership. From such compassion arises wisdom.</string>
		<string>The true victors in life are those who, enduring repeated challenges and setbacks, have sent the roots of their being to such a depth that nothing can shake them.</string>
		<string>March 16, Kosen-rufu Day. The spirit of this day lies not in magnificent ceremonies or high-sounding words. It lies in being victorious. That is the most crucial thing in all endeavors. In life and in kosen-rufu, we either win or lose. I would like you to be absolute victors in both. No matter what excuses we try to make, giving in to defeat brings misery and loses us the respect of others. I hope each of you without exception will adorn your life with indestructible triumph.</string>
		<string>You mustn&apos;t allow yourselves to grow old before your time. Please live with a youthful spirit. That is what Buddhism teaches us to do, and it is how life ought to be lived. If you make a commitment to work for the sake of others, you will be rejuvenated. If you devote your life to helping others, you&apos;ll stay young. The power of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo guarantees that.</string>
		<string>Let us do our utmost to sustain the wonderfully warm atmosphere of the SGI—an atmosphere where members feel free to discuss whatever is on their minds. Unless we do so, our organization will stop growing, stop developing. The SGI is a world of humanity—of the heart, of faith, of compassion. It is a world of unity and mutual inspiration. That is why it is strong. If we continue to value and promote these qualities, the SGI will continue to grow and develop forever. I want to declare here and now the atmosphere where we can discuss anything is fundamental to the SGI.</string>
		<string>By devoting ourselves earnestly to SGI activities, we gain the ability to turn all difficulties and obstacles into benefit, recognizing that earthly desires and delusions are enlightenment and that the sufferings of birth and death are nirvana. No matter how unpleasant the circumstances we find ourselves in, we can transform them into hope and good fortune—into eternal happiness. How incredible this is!</string>
		<string>There may be times when life seems gloomy and dull. When we feel stuck in some situation or other, when we are negative toward everything, when we feel lost and bewildered, not sure which way to turn—at such times we must transform our passive mind-set and determine, &quot;I will proceed along this path,&quot; &quot;I will pursue my mission today.&quot; When we do so a genuine springtime arrives in our hearts, and flowers start to blossom.</string>
		<string>Why is it that sometimes our prayers seem to not be answered? This is a manifestation of the Buddha&apos;s wisdom—so that we can deepen our prayers, become stronger people, live more profound lives and secure deeper, more lasting good fortune. If our slightest prayer were answered immediately, we&apos;d become lazy and degenerate. And we couldn&apos;t hope to build a life of great dignity and substance.</string>
		<string>I call to each of you: Strive for prosperity! Strive for development! Strive for victory! Life is about striving all out to achieve our aims; it is about hard work and effort. Regardless of how smart you may be, intelligence alone cannot guarantee your future.</string>
		<string>Let us all set our sights on leading great lives dedicated always to truth and move toward that goal in good health, brimming with hope. Let us live our lives boldly, without regret, advancing with patience, enthusiasm and a genuine spirit of friendship and camaraderie.</string>
		<string>The struggle we go through to have our prayers answered makes us stronger. If we were to immediately get everything we prayed for, we would become spoiled and decadent. We would lead indolent lives, devoid of any hard work or struggle. As a result, we would become shallow human beings. What, then, would be the point of faith?</string>
		<string>We are no longer in an age when one person can shoulder everything. Of course, for the day-to-day running of the organization someone will still be officially designated as president, but ultimately our future development hinges on every member having the commitment required of a Soka Gakkai president. With this spirit, this sense of responsibility, this leadership in your activities, may you always work for kosen-rufu and for the victory of the people. May you also build a Soka Gakkai where everyone can advance joyfully, a Soka Gakkai of undying progress.</string>
		<string>Of foremost importance are the people—not celebrities, the powerful, the rich, scholars or others whom society deems great or praiseworthy. The purpose of all things must be the happiness of the people. Everything else should be but a means to that end. Those who fail to recognize this fundamental point and look down on the people and exploit them are thoroughly vile and contemptible; they are a hindrance to people&apos;s happiness.</string>
		<string>While controlling your mind, which is at once both extremely subtle and solemnly profound, you should strive to elevate your faith with freshness and vigor. When you do so, both your life and your surroundings will open wide before you and every action you take will become a source of benefit. Understanding the subtle workings of one&apos;s mind is the key to faith and attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.</string>
		<string>Nichiren wrote that wrath can be either good or bad. Self-centered anger generates evil, but wrath at social injustice becomes the driving force for reform. Strong language that censures and combats a great evil often awakens adverse reactions from society, but this must not intimidate those who believe they are right. A lion is a lion because he roars.</string>
		<string>Molly Brown was on board the Titanic when it tragically sunk in 1912. Although she knew the ship was taking on water, she shouted to a panic-stricken fellow passenger: &quot;There&apos;s no danger. It simply can&apos;t go down, because I&apos;m on it and I&apos;m unsinkable.&quot; Her bantering words, which rang out with the determination never to be defeated and never to give in to despair are said to have given courage to her fellow passengers. Those who stand up at a crucial moment demonstrate genuine greatness.</string>
		<string>There are many elements involved in a prayer being answered, but the important thing is to keep praying until it is. By continuing to pray, you can reflect on yourself with unflinching honesty and begin to move your life in a positive direction on the path of earnest, steady effort. Even if your prayer doesn&apos;t produce concrete results immediately, your continual prayer will at some time manifest itself in a form greater than you had ever hoped.</string>
		<string>Position and appearances are irrelevant. The important thing is to carry out our personal duty, our commitment, no matter what anyone else may say. This is a life of true victory, a life of unsurpassed nobility and fulfillment.</string>
		<string>Emerson writes: &quot;And so of cheerfulness, or a good temper, the more it is spent, the more of it remains. Cheerfulness is not the same as frivolousness. Cheerfulness is born of a fighting spirit. Frivolousness is the reverse side of cowardly escape. Emerson also said that power dwells with cheerfulness; hope puts us in a working mood. Without cheerfulness there is no strength. Let us strive to advance still more brightly and cheerfully.</string>
		<string>Why are human beings born? This question has posed a great challenge. President Toda lucidly set forward his conclusion. Namely, that this world is a place for people to, as the Lotus Sutra states, enjoy themselves at ease.&quot; We were born here in order to thoroughly savor the joys of life. Faith in Nichiren Buddhism is what enables us to bring forth the great life force we need to lead such an existence.</string>
		<string>From one perspective, gongyo and daimoku are lyrics and songs. They are an ode to life. I hope, therefore, that your gongyo and daimoku will be such that even people who are not practicing will be favorably impressed by the sonorous and invigorating sound of your voices. That too will contribute to the spread of kosen-rufu.</string>
		<string>There is no means other than faith by which to open our lives and our inner state of Buddhahood. Faith is the most &quot;open&quot; state of mind of all. Infinite clusters of good fortune spill forth from this unbarred treasure house of life.</string>
		<string>In all things patience is the key to victory. Those who cannot endure cannot hope to win. Ultimate triumph belongs to those who can forbear.</string>
		<string>There is no retirement age in faith. Sincere faith never ages. Those who exert themselves for the sake of the Law are ever young. Our heart is what matters most. Let us strive to the end of our days for kosen-rufu.</string>
		<string>Strength is the source of happiness. We mustn&apos;t shy away from life&apos;s challenges. We mustn&apos;t be defeated. Refusing to be defeated equals victory. A person who perseveres to the end is a winner. In the course of promoting our movement, the Soka Gakkai has never pulled back in the face of any hindrance. We have kept moving forward. And that is the key to our success. Never to retreat a single step, no matter what—that is the Soka Gakkai spirit. Those who embrace this spirit can achieve unlimited victory.</string>
		<string>Great individuals fight abuses of authority. The truly strong do not lord it over the weak. People of genuine strength and courage battle against the powerful, the arrogant, the authoritarian, the evil and corrupt—all who look down on the people with contempt.</string>
		<string>Nothing is wasted in faith. One never loses out. Please be confident that all your efforts to help others and promote Buddhism are accumulating immense treasures of good fortune in your life. This is what is meant by inconspicuous benefit.</string>
		<string>Nichiren&apos;s words are guiding principles that have universal, eternal relevance. It is important to study his writings. And it is especially crucial that the members of the youth division gain a solid grounding in Buddhist study. The two ways of practice and study are important. A halfhearted attitude will not allow you to complete these two paths. That would be a truly sad thing.</string>
		<string>As long as our mind of faith is connected to the Gohonzon, our benefits will never disappear. That&apos;s why it is vital for us to persevere in our Buddhist practice throughout our lives, no matter what, even if on some days our physical condition or other circumstances prevent us from doing gongyo and chanting daimoku to our full satisfaction. Those who continue to challenge themselves to the end savor ultimate victory.</string>
		<string>Young people are the leaders of the twenty-first century. For that reason it is important that you have an understanding of history, that you can see through to the heart of things. A penetrating view of history is essential. A superficial one won&apos;t suffice.</string>
		<string>Quite simply, there can be no true democracy unless the citizens of a country realize that they are sovereign, that they are the main protagonists, and then with wisdom and a strong sense of responsibility take action based on that realization. Democracy cannot be successful in its mission unless the people rouse themselves to become more informed and involved, unless they unite, unless they establish an unshakable force for justice and keep a strict eye on the activities of the powerful.</string>
		<string>Thoreau, a renowned American Renaissance thinker, wrote in his journal: &quot;Nothing must be postponed. Take time by the forelock. Now or never! You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment.&quot; We shouldn&apos;t put anything off but seize the moment, living with all our being in the present. If we do that, he says, each moment will become eternity.</string>
		<string>Material possessions cannot be enjoyed after death. But millionaires rich in life force are able to freely make use of the treasures of the universe in lifetime after lifetime and enjoy a journey of eternal happiness. That is what constitutes proof of true victory in life.</string>
		<string>Spending our time doing what we please may bring momentary pleasure, but it will not bring us true and lasting joy; we cannot become great artists or great actors of life—we cannot become great human beings. Literature, music and drama are all to be found in our activities for faith—in our prayers, our challenges to develop ourselves through SGI activities and our efforts to educate others. All value is encompassed in these activities. This is the profound realm of Buddhism.</string>
		<string>Nothing can equal the splendor of youth. To be young is to possess a treasure of infinite worth, far greater than any person of power. This is all the more true of you who possess the eternal treasure of the Mystic Law. Those who live based on this supreme Law are bodhisattvas and Buddhas.</string>
		<string>Those who advance together with this organization that is dedicated to kosen-rufu and pervaded by benefit will evolve the correct mind of faith that matches the time. With this mind of faith you can fill the canvas of your lives with portraits of happiness in which all your wishes are fulfilled.</string>
		<string>At a crucial moment it is the strength and courage of ordinary people who have no name or position in society that save the day. The famous, the well-connected, almost always have too much to lose, and they abandon the cause in order to protect themselves.</string>
		<string>To possess both wisdom and compassion is the heart of our human revolution. If you have wisdom alone and lack compassion, it will be a cold, perverse wisdom. If you have compassion alone and lack wisdom, you cannot give happiness to others. You are even likely to lead them in the wrong direction, and you won&apos;t be able to achieve your own happiness.</string>
		<string>Buddhism is reason. It doesn&apos;t exist apart from society, apart from reality. That is why it is important for each of us to cultivate good judgment and common sense. We must respect and harmonize with society&apos;s ways. Respecting the life of each individual, we work among the people. This is the SGI&apos;s fundamental creed.</string>
		<string>I hope you will always have the spirit to learn with a lively curiosity and interest. When leaders are enthusiastic to keep on learning and growing, they inspire others. New ideas emerge and spread. Fresh energy to advance surges forth. Instead of pretending to know all the answers, assuming an air of wisdom, let us always strive for greater understanding and insight into all manner of things, so that we can continue learning together and spur one another to grow. This is the kind of spirit I want to cherish.</string>
		<string>We each move forward secure on our own earth, not the earth of others. Happiness is something we must create for ourselves. No one else can give it to us.</string>
		<string>When youth are awakened to a sense of mission, their power is limitless. Ultimately, we have to entrust our hopes and visions for the future to the youth. This is a golden rule. Youth is pure. Youth will rise up to fulfill their ideals without calculation or self-interest. The fundamental spirit of a leader must be to reach out to such young people, work with them and bring out their capabilities and direct their youthful energies in a positive direction.</string>
		<string>Adversity gives birth to greatness. The greater the challenges and difficulties we face, the greater opportunity we have to grow and develop as people. A life without adversity, a life of ease and comfort, produces nothing and leaves us with nothing. This is one of the indisputable facts of life.</string>
		<string>What matters is winning in the end; the wins and losses along the way are of secondary significance. It&apos;s final victory in life that counts and that is the reason for our Buddhist practice. No matter how powerful or famous or privileged a person might be, Nichiren says, from a Buddhist point of view it is all nothing more than a dream, an illusory pleasure; true happiness can only be attained by revealing the state of Buddhahood within your own life.</string>
		<string>Age is not an excuse for giving up. If you allow yourself to grow passive and draw back, it&apos;s a sign of personal defeat. There may be a retirement age at work, but there is no retirement age in life. How then could there be any &quot;going into retirement&quot; in the world of faith? The Buddhist Law is eternal, extending across the three existences of past, present and future, and one of the benefits of faith is perennial youth and eternal life.</string>
		<string>How incredible it is to chant this wonderful daimoku each day! Nichiren writes, &quot;There is no greater happiness for human beings than chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The sutra [Lotus Sutra] says, &apos;The people there [in my land] are happy and at ease&apos;&quot; (MW-1, 161). There is no joy, happiness and ease surpassing what we can attain through chanting daimoku. No matter how much you may pursue the things you love and skip gongyo to have a good time—all such fleeting, worldly pleasures pale beside the deep sense of satisfaction that comes from chanting daimoku.</string>
		<string>What is success in life? Who are the truly successful? There are famous and powerful people who become pitiful figures in their old age. There are people who die alone, feeling empty and desolate inside. Just what is success? The English thinker Walter Pater (1839–94) wrote: &quot;To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life.&quot; The person who lives life fully, glowing with life&apos;s energy, is the person who lives a successful life.</string>
		<string>Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral (1889–1957) of Chile was well respected as a humanistic educator. Indicative of the great spirit of compassion and caring with which she interacted with her students is her &quot;Teacher&apos;s Prayer&quot;: &quot;Let me be more mother than the mother herself in my love and defense of the child who is not flesh of my flesh. Help me to make one of my children my most perfect poem and leave within him or her my most melodious melody from that day when my own lips no longer sing.&quot; With this same spirit, let us care for and nurture young people.</string>
		<string>As you make your way home tonight, may you pause for a moment to gaze up at the night sky and let your heart communicate with the moon in wordless dialogue. Perhaps you might compose a poem and set it down in your journal entry for today. I would like you to possess such a poetic spirit.</string>
		<string>No matter how healthy, intelligent or affluent we may be, if our minds are weak, then our happiness will also be frail and brittle. Our minds of faith, moreover, enable us to bring out the full potential in all things and situations, so it is crucial that we strive to forge our minds of faith.</string>
		<string>As direct disciples of Nichiren, we have summoned forth the three powerful enemies of Buddhism. And defeating their schemes and repelling their onslaughts, we have carved out a great path of kosen-rufu. This has been the unrivaled pride of Mr. Makiguchi, Mr. Toda and myself as Soka Gakkai presidents. It is indisputable proof that the Soka Gakkai is the foremost organization in the entire world acting in accord with the Buddha&apos;s will and decree.</string>
		<string>The expansive world lies not in some distant place; it exists right where you are. That is why you need to win where you are right now. Today&apos;s victory is linked to your eternal victory.</string>
		<string>This is what I would like to communicate to you, my young friends who are the heirs of the Soka legacy: Live out your lives together with the SGI, an organization fulfilling the Buddha&apos;s decree! Our activities in the organization of faith constitute our Buddhist practice, lead to the realization of kosen-rufu and enable us to carry out our human revolution. To think selfishly, &quot;I&apos;ll just practice on my own and however I like&quot; cannot be called correct faith. Such people are Buddhist in name only; they are not true practitioners.</string>
		<string>We have both a weak self and a strong self; the two are completely different. If we allow our weak side to dominate, we will be defeated. The thought, &quot;I am still young and have a lot of time, so I can relax and take life easy&quot; is a function of our weakness.</string>
		<string>Many things happen in life. There are joyous days and times of suffering. Sometimes unpleasant things occur. But that&apos;s what makes life so interesting. The dramas we encounter are part and parcel of being human. If we experienced no change or drama in our lives, if nothing unexpected ever happened, we would merely be like automatons, our lives unbearably monotonous and dull. Therefore, please develop a strong self so that you can enact the drama of your life with confidence and poise in the face of whatever vicissitudes you may encounter.</string>
		<string>No one is more wonderful than a mother. And there is nothing more noble than a mother&apos;s heart. I hope you will all treasure your mothers. Truly praiseworthy are those who have a sense of gratitude and appreciation toward their parents. The Buddhist sutras teach that the practice of Buddhism is the ultimate expression of devotion to one&apos;s parents, and the Buddha excels in such dedication and concern.</string>
		<string>Buddhism is concerned with the essential nature of humanity. Buddhism is not found somewhere else separate from such beautiful expressions of humanity as appreciation toward one&apos;s mother and courtesy to others. As Nichiren teaches in the Gosho, &quot;behavior as a human being&quot; that perfectly accords with reason is what constitutes the heart of Buddhism. Therefore, our world of faith must be a gathering that is full of affection and heartfelt consideration.</string>
		<string>The state of mind with which we meet our death will greatly influence the course of our lives over eternity. Granted, if one is unconcerned by how one dies, or if one dismisses any connection between this existence and the next, then there probably isn&apos;t any need to practice Nichiren Buddhism. But the truth is that life is eternal, that our existence continues even after we die. Moreover, during the latent stage of death before rebirth, we cannot change the essence of our lives, we cannot carry out Buddhist practice. Only while we are alive as human beings can we practice Buddhism.</string>
		<string>Nichiren urges us to earnestly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, even just once or twice, stressing that if we do so we will definitely attain enlightenment. Now some might immediately think: &quot;All right! I&apos;ll just put faith aside and take it easy, then embrace faith seriously a year before I die.&quot; But Nichiren&apos;s words in this instance are meant to spur his followers to devote greater efforts to their Buddhist practice, emphasizing the beneficial power of chanting even a single daimoku. The correct way to read the Gosho is to always interpret Nichiren&apos;s words from the standpoint of strengthening our faith.</string>
		<string>I want you to understand the subtle workings of the mind. How you orient your mind, the kind of attitude you take, greatly influences both you yourself and your environment. The Buddhist principle of a single life-moment encompassing three thousand realms completely elucidates the true aspect of life&apos;s inner workings. Through the power of strong inner resolve, we can transform ourselves, those around us and the land in which we live.</string>
		<string>During our dialogue, Dr. Arnold Toynbee at one point told me that his motto was Laboremus, Latin for &quot;Let&apos;s get to work!&quot; Nichiren Buddhism focuses on the present and future; it is infused with the spirit, &quot;Let&apos;s get started!&quot; We practice for the sake of the present and future. It is important not to become trapped in the past; we have to put it behind us. The Buddhism of true cause is always based on the present moment; it is always &quot;from this moment on.&quot;</string>
		<string>Kosen-rufu is a long-term struggle we are pursuing over the ten thousand years of the Latter Day. Therefore, as we strive to realize victory in the present, we need to maintain a vision of the next fifty or one hundred years. Each day I am making efforts with my focus on the infinite future.</string>
		<string>Ralph Waldo Emerson says, &quot;Good-nature is plentiful, but we want justice with a heart of steel, to fight down the proud.&quot; If people are merely good-natured, then those who are arrogant and highhanded will have free rein to carry on as they please. Only those who fight with hearts of steel are people of justice.</string>
		<string>There has never been, nor will there ever be, a Buddha who does not encounter hardships. Only by struggling against difficulties can we attain the life-state of Buddhahood. Herein lies the essence of Buddhism.</string>
		<string>Don&apos;t be dependent on anyone—this is my sentiment. We each have to strengthen and develop ourselves through our own efforts. We must never surrender to any foe or difficulty. We must be fearless. This is the true spirit of self-reliance.</string>
		<string>Those who have experienced great suffering must win in life and become happy. If you&apos;re always losing and miserable, then you are not practicing Nichiren Buddhism correctly. You are not following the true path in life. Buddhism teaches the means by which the sad can become happy and the happy become happier still. That is the reason for our practice.</string>
		<string>From the standpoint of the eternity of our lives, because we embrace the Mystic Law everything is moving in a positive direction, everything contributes to our happiness and our attainment of Buddhahood. We need to have confidence in the Mystic Law; we mustn&apos;t be swayed by immediate circumstances or allow them to cloud our faith.</string>
		<string>We mustn&apos;t be afraid of anything. It is important to remain firm in our convictions. There is a great deal of scheming and duplicity in the world. It is foolish to allow ourselves to be swayed by such things; it only leads to unhappiness. The Mystic Law and Nichiren are absolutely free of any falsehood. Therefore, to dedicate our lives to kosen-rufu is to lead the wisest possible existence.</string>
		<string>We must live with vibrant hope. Nothing is stronger than hope. The Mystic Law is itself eternal hope. Happiness belongs to those who never despair, no matter what happens.</string>
		<string>We need to cultivate a state of life where we can thoroughly enjoy ourselves at all times. We should have such joy that even at the time of death we can declare with a happy smile: &quot;That was wonderful! Where shall I go next?&quot; This is the state of mind of a person with strong faith. Such individuals will be reborn without delay and in a form and in a place exactly according with their desires. Faith enables us to attain the kind of generous and all-embracing state of mind where we can enjoy everything in our lives.</string>
		<string>We need to cultivate the spirit to live with self-assurance, to make our way joyously through life. We practice this faith precisely to forge such a strong and vibrant inner resolve.</string>
		<string>President Toda said: &quot;Those who do not value the organization are practicing self-centered faith. With such faith you cannot expect to receive the truly profound benefits of this practice.&quot; Working hard within the organization for people&apos;s happiness and welfare is itself a truly noble Buddhist practice.</string>
		<string>The heart is most important of all. In his classic The Little Prince, the French author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry writes: &quot;It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.&quot; It is just as he says. We cannot always tell whether something is genuine just with our eyes. Only by looking with the heart can we discern the true essence.</string>
		<string>In Buddhism, we either win or lose—there is no middle ground. Now and in the future, let us advance, determined to win in every sphere of our lives. By winning in our lives, we are advancing kosen-rufu, and by advancing kosen-rufu, we win in our lives.</string>
		<string>Forward! Always forward! This is a basic spirit of Buddhism. Nichiren&apos;s teaching is the Buddhism of true cause. We live with our gaze fixed on the future, not hung up on the past. To advance eternally—this is the essence of life and the essence of what it means to be a practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism.</string>
		<string>What is true joy in life? This is a difficult question—and one that has occupied a great many thinkers and philosophers. Joy can quickly give way to suffering. Joy is short and suffering long. Also what passes for joy in society is superficial. It cannot compare with the joy deriving from the Mystic Law. The key then lies in cultivating a state of mind where we can declare without reservation that life itself is a joy. This is the purpose of our Buddhist practice.</string>
		<string>We who embrace the Mystic Law will not suffer on account of old age or death. As long as we keep the flame of faith alive, the fire of life force will forever burn brightly within us; we can live with great confidence transcending birth and death. Faith is the engine that enables us to live with hope throughout our lives.</string>
		<string>Those who make many friends have greater opportunities for growth and self-development; as such they make society a better place and lead happy, satisfying lives. In every situation, human relations—communication and personal interaction—are vital. We need to initiate and nurture friendships and contacts with many people, both within the organization and in society at large. Our lives will open and be enriched to the extent that we do so.</string>
		<string>Buddhism is about bringing happiness, joy and fulfillment to all. It enables us not only to become happy ourselves but to make causes for the enlightenment of our ancestors seven-plus generations back and for the happiness and prosperity of our children, grandchildren and descendants throughout future generations. This is the great benefit of Buddhism.</string>
		<string>A coward cannot become a Buddha. We cannot attain Buddhahood unless we possess the heart of a lion. The harsher the situation, the bolder the stand we must take. This is the essence of the Soka Gakkai spirit.</string>
		<string>No matter where we go, we cannot escape from the sufferings that are part and parcel of life. If we cannot avoid these sufferings, then our only choice is to overcome them. And since we have no choice but to overcome them, then we might as well live joyfully and vigorously while doing so. Let&apos;s continue to strive and chant daimoku to the end.</string>
		<string>A Buddha is definitely not an absolute being living a static existence. A Buddha shares the sufferings of others and, sensing the condition of the time, earnestly ponders how to transform that condition. A Buddha vows to struggle in order to lead the people and the age to enlightenment. The strength of this vow causes the Buddha&apos;s enlightenment to mature into rich wisdom.</string>
		<string>Because we live in the human realm, we of course experience problems and suffering. Life is filled with contradictions. But if we refuse to be defeated by them and persist in our faith, we are certain to advance along the path towards happiness and victory. This is the essential power of Buddhism.</string>
		<string>Cowardice is harmful for it delights the enemies of Buddhism and obstructs the advance of kosen-rufu. The fainthearted cannot savor the true benefit of faith; their ability to tap the power of the Buddha and the power of the Law [of the Gohonzon] in their lives is enfeebled.</string>
		<string>Science is based on tested proof or empirical evidence. You conduct a test or experiment and then observe the results. Nichiren Buddhism, similarly, teaches that nothing beats actual proof. In this regard, it stands alone among the religions of the world. I hope that each year you will strive to show clear proof of victory in Buddhism and your studies. Please always remember that showing such proof is the mark of a true successor.</string>
		<string>Faith and daily life, faith and work—these are not separate things. They are one and the same. To think of them as separate—that faith is faith, and work is work—is theoretical faith. Based on the recognition that work and faith are one and the same, we should put one hundred percent of our energy into our jobs and one hundred percent into our faith, too. When we resolve to do this, we enter the path of victory in life. Faith means to show irrefutable proof of victory amid the realities of society and in our own daily lives.</string>
		<string>President Toda often said that the final four or five years of one&apos;s life are decisive. No matter how good the preceding years may have been, one&apos;s life ends in defeat and sadness if the final few years are miserable. On the other hand, someone whose last four or five years are happy and filled with joy can be described a winner in life. No matter what happens, even if we should fall sick, we must never grow discouraged or allow ourselves to be defeated. This is vital. As long as our spirits are undefeated, we are victors.</string>
		<string>We have to make ourselves heard. We have to speak out for what we believe in. When we, the people, boldly state our true convictions—never losing our optimism or sense of humor—the times will change. When it comes to speaking out for justice, there isn&apos;t any need for restraint. On the contrary, to be reserved or hesitant under such circumstances is wrong.</string>
		<string>When something needs saying, it is our duty to speak out. When something is right, we should say so; and when something is wrong or mistaken, we should likewise point it out. Cheating, lies or scheming should be denounced with alacrity. It is precisely because we have done this that the Soka Gakkai and the SGI have developed to the extent they have. To say what must be said—that is the spirit of propagation and the essence of the Soka Gakkai and the SGI.</string>
		<string>This is the era of youth. Youth do not depend on anyone. Nor do they hang on someone else&apos;s coattails. &quot;I will open the way forward myself. I will advance kosen-rufu. I will see to it that the SGI is victorious.&quot; This is the spirit of youth and the attitude of true successors who love and cherish the SGI.</string>
		<string>Education definitely changes people&apos;s lives. This is why the SGI is so earnest when it comes to Buddhist study, which is the highest field of learning; it is the study of human beings and the foremost education. Buddhist study is the soul of the SGI.</string>
		<string>It all comes down to hope. If we SGI members advance with hope and buoyant spirits, then we have nothing to fear in either the present or the future. The Law will continue to spread as long as those who uphold it remain vigorous and well.</string>
		<string>Chanting daimoku is the foundation of Nichiren Buddhism. When we chant sonorous daimoku, the sun rises in our hearts. We are filled with power. Compassion wells forth. Our lives are lit with joy. Our wisdom shines. All Buddhas and Buddhist deities throughout the universe go to work on our behalf. Life becomes exhilarating.</string>
		<string>Nichiren teaches the meaning of true happiness and the true purpose of life. Fame and momentary glories are no more than illusions. True happiness lies in cultivating the great state of Buddhahood within one&apos;s life. This is life&apos;s true purpose. By chanting daimoku, we can change all of our sufferings into the ingredients for attaining a Buddha&apos;s lofty state of life.</string>
		<string>One of my favorite Argentine poets, the great educator Almafuerte (1854–1917), wrote: &quot;To the weak, difficulty is a closed door. To the strong, however, it is a door waiting to be opened.&quot; Difficulties impede the progress of those who are weak. For the strong, however, they are opportunities to open wide the doors to a bright future. Everything is determined by our attitude, by our resolve. Our heart is what matters most.</string>
		<string>How exhilarating it is to stand tall, walk with a buoyant step and be flexible in one&apos;s actions! How attractive to those we meet are our sparkling eyes and vibrant voices! This is the principle of the true entity of all phenomena. Your fresh and vital appearance eloquently attests to the greatness of faith, and you will find that you naturally cultivate a sphere of friendship and understanding among those around you.</string>
		<string>The great American poet Walt Whitman writes in Leaves of Grass: &quot;All comes by the body, only health puts you rapport with the universe.&quot; I am sure you are all very busy, but I hope you will advance in good health and with optimism and enjoy the power of your faith, which is what puts you in rhythm with the universe.</string>
		<string>I hope that you will lead immortal, invincible and joyous lives, filled with confidence, pride and good cheer. I also hope you will display inspiring leadership, while doing your utmost to protect your respective areas.</string>
		<string>Your faith guarantees that an infinite number of your ancestors and descendants will attain Buddhahood. Such is the wondrous power of the Mystic Law. How profound and important is your existence! There is also no greater way to repay the debt of gratitude to your parents than through faith.</string>
		<string>When you devote your life to achieving your goal, you will not be bothered by shallow criticism. In fact nothing important can be accomplished if you allow yourself to be swayed by some trifling matter, always looking over your shoulder and wondering what others are saying or thinking. The key to achievement is to move forward resolutely along your chosen path.</string>
		<string>It&apos;s foolish to be obsessed with past failures. And it&apos;s just as foolish to be self-satisfied with one&apos;s small achievements. Buddhism teaches that the present and the future are what are important, not the past. It teaches us a spirit of unceasing challenge to win over the present and advance ever toward the future. Those who neglect this spirit of continual striving steer their lives in a ruinous direction.</string>
		<string>Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, later remarked that one&apos;s inner life is the true Olympics. Life itself is an Olympics where we strive each day to better our own personal records.</string>
		<string>You must be strong. There is no hope of winning in this chaotic world if you are weak. No matter what others do or say, it is important to develop your ability and then put that ability to use. Strong faith, of course, is the best means for drawing out one&apos;s inner strength. You each have a very important mission, and I hope you will awaken to and be proud of that mission.</string>
		<string>We live in an age where opportunities for profound life-to-life inspiration are all but nonexistent. Idle amusements bring only fleeting pleasure. They produce neither profound inspiration nor growth for one&apos;s life. By contrast, Buddhism exists to enable people to realize personal growth and to improve their lives. Buddhism is always rooted in the reality of life. It is the wellspring of wisdom for bringing harmony and happiness to our families, local communities and society at large.</string>
		<string>This spirit of engaging others in dialogue on equal terms is the essence of Buddhism. Ordering people about in a high-handed, arrogant manner, shouting at them to do one&apos;s bidding, is truly deplorable behavior. Such a world has no relation to Buddhism. Through dialogue Shakyamuni opened hearts that were closed, softened hearts that had grown hard and melted hearts that were frozen.</string>
		<string>In a world where indifference and inhumanity prevail, let us use our discussion meetings as the pivot for creating oases of peace and harmony in our homes and in our local communities and then extending them to encompass every sphere of society.</string>
		<string>In the &quot;Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings,&quot; Nichiren says, &quot;One should regard meeting obstacles as true peace and comfort&quot; (Gosho Zenshu, p. 750). You may wonder how encountering obstacles could be a source of peace and comfort. But the truth of the matter is that through struggling against and overcoming difficulties, we can transform our destiny and attain Buddhahood. Confronting adversity, therefore, represents peace and comfort.</string>
		<string>The important thing is to advance brightly and strive to be victorious at each moment, right where we are; to begin something here and now instead of fretting and worrying over what will happen. This is the starting point for transforming our lives.</string>
		<string>The place where we are right now is what matters. This is all the more true for us who embrace the Mystic Law. Buddhism teaches that we can transform wherever we are into the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light.</string>
		<string>Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is like the roar of a lion, Nichiren says (MW-1, 119). It is by chanting powerful daimoku, like a lion&apos;s roar, that we can move the Buddhist deities, the protective forces of the universe. The voice is very important—it has profound power. While naturally being careful not to disturb your neighbors, I hope you will endeavor to chant cheerful and powerful daimoku that reaches all the Buddhist deities and Buddhas throughout the ten directions.</string>
		<string>The writer Goethe was an unflagging optimist. How was he able to maintain such optimism? Because he was always active. He did not allow his life to stagnate. He writes: &quot;It is better to do the smallest thing in the world than to hold half an hour to be too small a thing.&quot; Spending thirty minutes a day assiduously challenging some undertaking can completely change our lives.</string>
		<string>Those who have a mentor in life are truly fortunate. The path of mentor and disciple is one that leads to personal development and growth. Those without a mentor may appear free and unbeholden to anyone, but without a solid standard or model on which to base themselves their lives will be aimless and wandering.</string>
		<string>I place a high value on personal initiative. Kosen-rufu will be advanced by brave people armed with the spirit of independence who voluntarily strive to fulfill the vow they made in the remotest past. Because they struggle of their own volition, they have no complaints or grievances. The greater the obstacles they face, the greater the courage, wisdom and power they muster from within.</string>
		<string>What does attaining Buddhahood mean for us? It does not mean that one day we suddenly turn into a Buddha or become magically enlightened. In a sense, attaining Buddhahood means that we have securely entered the path, or orbit, of Buddhahood inherent in the cosmos. Rather than a final static destination at which we arrive and remain, achieving enlightenment means firmly establishing the faith needed to keep advancing along the path of absolute happiness limitlessly, without end.</string>
		<string>We could liken doing gongyo and chanting daimoku to the Earth&apos;s rotation on its axis, while taking part in activities resembles the Earth&apos;s revolution around the Sun. To enter this path, which enables us to savor a state where life is an unparalleled joy, is itself proof of our attainment of Buddhahood. In the present age, SGI activities represent the means by which we can attain Buddhahood.</string>
		<string>Vital are wisdom, tenacity and self-expression, as well as the strong life force that makes these things possible. Buddhism is an earnest struggle to win. This is what Nichiren teaches. A Buddhist, therefore, must not be defeated. I hope you will maintain an alert and winning spirit in your work and daily life, taking courageous action and showing triumphant actual proof time and again.</string>
		<string>We must make steady and persistent efforts firmly grounded in daily life. If we travel in the orbit of &quot;faith equals daily life,&quot; all our prayers will definitely be answered. We can then lead lives in which all our desires will be fulfilled. Should all our prayers be answered without our having to make any effort, we would grow lazy. Should all our desires be achieved without our ever having to experience suffering or hardship, we could not understand the pain and struggles of others, and our compassion would gradually wane.</string>
		<string>Even in times of hardship, the important thing is for each of us to determine that we are the star, protagonist and hero of our lives and keep moving forward. Putting ourselves down and shrinking back from the obstacles looming before us spell certain defeat. Through making ourselves strong and developing our state of life, we can definitely find a way through. As long as we uphold the Mystic Law throughout our lives, we can break through any impasse and surmount any obstacle. We will also be able to lead all those who are suffering to happiness.</string>
		<string>Beethoven is called a genius. But we need to be aware that his genius was based on incredibly strenuous effort. It all comes down to hard work, to tenacious efforts. You cannot become a person of the highest caliber if you have a casual, easygoing attitude, thinking things will somehow just fall into place. Accordingly, Beethoven&apos;s motto was &quot;No day without a line.&quot; Every day without fail, he wrote music. He would not let even a single day pass without working assiduously. To continue every day—this is just like our practice of gongyo. Making persistent efforts each day is a source of tremendous strength.</string>
		<string>It is important that youth in particular actively seek challenges to forge and strengthen themselves. Those who enjoy material luxury from a young age and do not work hard cannot become people of outstanding character. They cannot become great leaders who protect the people. I hope that you will work hard, sparing no effort, and develop yourselves as indomitable champions, shaken or disheartened by nothing.</string>
		<string>I imagine that some of you have family members who are not yet practicing Nichiren Buddhism. There is no need to be impatient or to agonize over this. Whether people take faith has to do with their mystic connection with Buddhism, which takes a variety of forms. Important is the presence of one person who is practicing. One person&apos;s attainment of Buddhahood brings happiness to family members and all those around him or her. When a single sun rises, everything is illuminated.</string>
		<string>The glory we enjoy in a dream vanishes without a trace when we awaken. When an illusion disappears, nothing is left of its joy except a sense of emptiness, like that which one feels when finally sobering from a state of drunkenness. The joy of Buddhahood, however, is profound, indestructible and everlasting.</string>
		<string>Governments come and go, economies rise and fall and society constantly changes. Only the good fortune that we accumulate during our lives lasts forever. The true victors are those who cultivate the tree of Buddhahood in the vast earth of their lives, while achieving success both in society and their personal lives through true faith and a true way of living.</string>
		<string>What is the treasure of youth? It is struggle; it is hard work. Unless you struggle, you cannot become truly strong. Those who fight hard during their youth will have nothing to fear when the time comes to put the finishing touches on their lives. They will possess a great state of life that towers strong and unshakable. In Buddhism, we call this the state of Buddhahood, which nothing can undermine or destroy. It is a state of mind enjoyed by invincible champions of life.</string>
		<string>The powerful may appear great, but in reality they are not. Greatest of all are the ordinary people. If those in power lead lives of idle luxury it is because the people are silent. We have to speak out. With impassioned words, we need to resolutely attack abuses of power that cause people suffering. This is fighting on the side of justice. It is wrong to remain silent when confronted with injustice. Doing so is tantamount to supporting and condoning evil.</string>
		<string>Life isn&apos;t always smooth. If it were, we would never grow and develop as human beings. If we succeed, we are envied; if we fail, we are ridiculed and attacked. Sadly, this is how people are. Unexpected grief and suffering may lie ahead of you. But it is precisely when you encounter such trying times that you must not be defeated. Never give up. Never retreat.</string>
		<string>There is no need to seek impatiently for greatness, fame or wealth. The Earth and Sun do not hurry; they follow their own path at their own pace. If the Earth were to accelerate and complete one rotation in three hours instead of twenty-four, we would be in big trouble! The most important thing in life, too, is to find a sure and certain path and confidently advance along it.</string>
		<string>Youth is a truly wonderful thing. Unfortunately, though, this is often something that&apos;s hard to appreciate when we&apos;re young. Life passes by quickly. Before we know it, we are old. That&apos;s why in our youth we should be as active as we possibly can. Rather than a life of blank pages, live a life crammed full of memories—of battles well fought and wonderfully diverse experiences. Not to leave behind any history, to just grow old and die, is a sad way to live.</string>
		<string>Our lives are ruled by impermanence. But simply realizing that changes nothing. There is no value in bleak pessimism. The challenge is how to create something of enduring value within the context of our impermanent lives. The Lotus Sutra teaches us how to do this.</string>
		<string>True and lasting happiness only and always comes from our own efforts, our own wisdom, our own good fortune. This is a fundamental truth. Faith is the key to strengthening our efforts, wisdom and good fortune; SGI activities are the key to strengthening ourselves.</string>
		<string>Without practice or actual efforts, there is no bodhisattva. Action is the essence of a Buddha. A self-centered life lived solely in pursuit of one&apos;s own benefit and fortune is empty and base. A Bodhisattva of the Earth, in contrast, respects others and works for their happiness.</string>
		<string>If we attain the state of Buddhahood in this lifetime, that state will forever pervade our lives. Throughout the cycle of birth and death, in each new lifetime, we are endowed with good health, wealth and intelligence, along with a supportive, comfortable environment, and lead lives that overflow with good fortune. Each of us will also possess a unique mission and be born in an appropriate form to fulfill it.</string>
		<string>Our lives are our own. It is not for someone else to dictate to us how we should live them. All that awaits those who allow themselves to be continually swayed by what other people say or do is unhappiness. We simply need to have the self-belief to be able to say: &quot;This is right. This is the path I will follow. I am content.&quot; Happiness is born from such inner fortitude. Moreover, those who earnestly devote themselves in accord with the Mystic Law cannot fail to realize lives of total fulfillment.</string>
		<string>What decides our real merit as human beings? Ultimately, it comes down to the philosophy we uphold and the actions we take based on our convictions.</string>
		<string>Faith is perseverance. The key to victory in any struggle in life is persistence. That is why Nichiren stresses the importance of having faith that flows ceaselessly like water rather than faith that flares up briefly like fire. To advance continuously, it is important never to become exhausted. Carrying out activities until late at night does not equate with strong faith.</string>
		<string>Buddhism is found in the reality of society and daily life. Because Buddhism is in no way separate from this reality, we must strive through our actions to be exemplary models for others.</string>
		<string>Life is a process of ongoing challenge. Those who lead lives of boundless challenge realize boundless growth. In a time of tumultuous change, what people need most are the vitality to challenge their circumstances, the wisdom to open the treasure house of knowledge, and to strive ceaselessly to create value.</string>
		<string>The ultimate essence of Nichiren Buddhism lies in living on through to the very end, pressing ever forward, courageously taking on each new challenge we encounter and never giving up. Constructing eternal glory—the state of Buddhahood—within our own lives is the purpose of our Buddhist practice in this lifetime; hence Nichiren&apos;s constant urging that we make tenacious efforts in the present.</string>
		<string>Faith enables us to secure ultimate victory. It enables us to live with vigor and joy and to strive to improve ourselves—to become the very best people we can be. Moreover, faith enables us to walk through life with complete assurance and confidence, unafraid of anything.</string>
		<string>What is the secret to victory? Mr. Toda once described that in a certain sense life is a gamble. &quot;If you are lucky, you will win,&quot; he said. &quot;But if you are unlucky, then sometimes no matter how hard you try you lose. This is a hard fact.&quot; That is why, in addition to ability, good fortune is essential. The key to creating good fortune is found in faith and daimoku. I hope that you will all act in accord with the fundamental Law of Buddhism and lead victorious lives filled with unsurpassed good fortune.</string>
		<string>We must not allow ourselves to become bureaucratic and take for granted the efforts of those working behind the scenes. Nor must we ever forget to be considerate of those members of our families who may not be practicing Nichiren Buddhism. We must remember that for every person involved in SGI activities there is another, supporting him or her behind the scenes.</string>
		<string>The greater our efforts to advance kosen-rufu, the greater the benefit and eternal good fortune we will accumulate in our lives. The more outstanding people we can foster, the stronger and healthier we will become. The more aware we are of our responsibility, the more joy we will experience. Such are the workings of the Buddhist Law.</string>
		<string>As human beings, let us reach beyond our small, limited selves and attain an all-encompassing state of being, our hearts communing with the vast universe.</string>
		<string>The resolve to accomplish your goals is what counts. If you earnestly put your mind to something, your brain, your body, your environment—everything—will start working toward achieving that end.</string>
		<string>We cannot build true character if we allow ourselves to be swayed by passing praise or censure. &quot;Don&apos;t concern yourself with petty criticisms! Commune constantly with fine books and fine people and improve yourself!&quot; This was the creed by which Mr. Makiguchi and Mr. Toda lived their lives.</string>
		<string>Youth, and indeed life itself, flash by in the blink of an eye. That is why it is important for you to ask yourselves what you can do for those who are suffering, what you can do to resolve the mournful contradictions that plague society, and boldly take on these great challenges without shunning the problems and difficulties you will inevitably face.</string>
		<string>Gandhi stressed the importance of being resolute in one&apos;s determinations: &quot;A man who says that he will do something &apos;as far as possible&apos; betrays either his pride or his weakness, though he himself may attribute it to his humility. There is, in fact, not a trace of humility in such an attitude of mind.&quot; In short, he asserts that someone who makes halfhearted pronouncements is either arrogant or cowardly.</string>
		<string>The present, as I am sure you all sense, is an age pervaded by great weariness and apathy. I would like you to be aware that the power and energy to serve humanity in such an enervated age can only be born from a vigorous, indomitable, noble will. Though the times may be rife with petty human conflicts, a pervading sense of hopelessness and all manner of turbulent storms, I hope that all of you will forge ahead boldly with unflagging good cheer.</string>
		<string>The course of our lives is determined by how we react—what we decide and what we do—at the darkest of times. The nature of that response determines a person&apos;s true worth and greatness.</string>
		<string>From one perspective, Buddhist practice means plunging into the midst of the people and striving to strengthen our life force to the greatest extent. The purpose of SGI activities is for each of us to be able to build a strong, invincible, diamondlike self that can overcome every difficulty and blaze a way forward wherever we go. Obstacles are a golden opportunity to quickly forge an inner self that is as indestructible as a diamond, able to endure for eternity.</string>
		<string>Even places that have been shrouded in darkness for billions of years can be illuminated. Even a stone from the bottom of a river can be used to produce fire. Our present sufferings, no matter how dark, have certainly not continued for billions of years—nor will they linger forever. The sun will definitely rise. In fact, its ascent has already begun.</string>
		<string>Courage is free. Anyone can have it. Courage is another name for the SGI spirit. Mr. Toda said: &quot;The Buddha is filled with compassion, but it is hard for us common mortals to show compassion. So we must have courage instead.&quot; In other words, when we work courageously for kosen-rufu, our actions by their very nature become compassionate.</string>
		<string>In the face of rejection, you must learn to be courageous. It is important to believe in yourself. Be like the sun, which shines on serenely even though not all the heavenly bodies reflect back its light and even though some of its brilliance seems to radiate only into empty space. While those who reject your friendship may sometimes fade out of your life, the more you shine your light, the more brilliant your life will become.</string>
		<string>The German author Hermann Hesse (1877–1962) writes that the more one matures, the younger one grows. And certainly there are many people who, as they age, become increasingly vigorous and energetic, more broad-minded and tolerant, living with a greater sense of freedom and assurance. It is important to remember that aging and growing old are not necessarily the same thing.</string>
		<string>The first thing is to pray. From the moment we begin to pray, things start moving. The darker the night, the closer the dawn. From the moment we chant daimoku with a deep and powerful resolve, the sun begins to rise in our hearts. Hope—prayer is the sun of hope. To chant daimoku each time we face a problem, overcoming it and elevating our life-condition as a result—this is the path of &quot;changing earthly desires into enlightenment,&quot; taught in Nichiren Buddhism.</string>
		<string>Certainly there will be times when you wish you had more spending money, more time to sleep and more time for fun and recreation. You may feel restricted now, but you should consider your current situation as the perfect set of circumstances for your growth. Within the restrictions that define your present existence, the only thing to do is to discipline yourself and head in the direction of growth and self-improvement. In the process of exerting yourself in such endeavors, you will without a doubt build and strengthen your character.</string>
		<string>There is nothing more noble than inviting our friends to discussion meetings, gathering together to enable them to establish a connection with Buddhism, to talk about Buddhist teachings, and to deepen our faith. As the Lotus Sutra clearly indicates, through such steady, dedicated efforts to teach others about Buddhism, you are accumulating the good fortune and benefit to be reborn as great leaders and savor a state of unsurpassed freedom in lifetime after lifetime.</string>
		<string>Buddhism is action. One meaning of kyo of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is action. Without action, we cannot say that we are practicing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo; it would merely remain a concept. Only through action are we able to truly gain the great benefit of the Mystic Law.</string>
		<string>Buddhism is wisdom. As long as we have wisdom, we can put all things to the best use; we can turn everything in the direction of happiness.</string>
		<string>To be fearless no matter what happens—that is the root of true happiness. To move forward resolutely regardless of what lies in store—that is the spirit, the resolve, that leads to human victory. But if we allow ourselves to be disturbed by petty criticism and slander, if we fear pressure and persecution, we will never advance or create anything of lasting value.</string>
		<string>Those who say &quot;I&apos;ll do it,&quot; who are willing to take on a challenge even if they are alone, are true winners. The determination, the commitment to take action yourself, is the force that leads to victory. As Buddhism teaches in the principle of a life-moment possesses three thousand realms, our mind or attitude can change everything.</string>
		<string>It is not a question of your environment or those around you, nor what the organization or leaders may be like. To be swayed by such externals is pointless. It all comes down to one person: you. What matters is that you become a brilliant beacon, shining with joy and happiness, and live your life with confidence and courage. If you shine with a radiant light, there can be no darkness in your life.</string>
		<string>Wisdom, not might, is the most important thing. Wisdom and compassion are deeply connected. Giving earnest thought to others&apos; welfare, asking ourselves what can we do to help—using our minds in this way is a sign of compassion.</string>
		<string>Advancement—Nichiren teaches the spirit that &quot;not to advance is to retreat.&quot; The point is to continue forging ahead despite any storms or hardships that may arise, to be fearless and advance like a lion.</string>
		<string>Life flashes by in an instant. By devoting our lives to Buddhism, we will live a life of complete fulfillment. We are selling ourselves short if we fail to attain such a wonderful state of life.</string>
		<string>We accumulate great good fortune through our earnest prayers, devotion and efforts for the sake of Buddhism, kosen-rufu and humankind. Prayer without action is not the way of Nichiren Buddhism.</string>
		<string>The important thing is to keep working for kosen-rufu to the very end. On any journey, we cannot hope to reach our destination if we stop halfway. Likewise, if despite our good fortune in meeting and embarking on the unsurpassed way of Buddhism, we stop halfway, all the efforts we have made thus far will have been in vain; we will not be able to attain Buddhahood.</string>
		<string>Success is not a matter of accumulating more of this or that; it is not measured in quantity. It means changing the quality of your life. Wealth, power, fame and knowledge alone cannot make you happy, no matter how much of these you acquire. Nor can you take them with you when you die. But by improving the quality of your life you will at last approach true happiness.</string>
		<string>Worldly success and good circumstances based on luck can easily crumble. They are as transient as an illusion. But the state of Buddhahood, once attained, can never be destroyed, not for all eternity. We will enjoy an existence overflowing with good fortune and immense joy in lifetime after lifetime.</string>
		<string>Nichiren states, &quot;The voice does the Buddha&apos;s work&quot; (Gosho Zenshu, p. 708). To chant the Mystic Law is to praise the Gohonzon. Hearing the sound of our daimoku, the heavenly deities will be set into motion and work to protect us. A weak and unclear voice will not move the heavenly deities. That is why it is important for us to chant daimoku with voices that are clear, strong and brimming with joy.</string>
		<string>As long as we pray earnestly and sincerely with all our being, if we have strong and genuine faith, even though results may not be immediately visible, they will definitely manifest without fail in generations of our children and our children&apos;s children. I would like all of you to have absolute confidence in this.</string>
		<string>Children remember all their lives mothers who are always optimistic and generous toward society and the community and who live creatively. That kind of behavior provides the finest possible nourishment for learning how to build a happy home life. It is important for married couples, while giving full rein to their individual characteristics, to cooperate for the happiness of the children, the family and society.</string>
		<string>The stronger the oppression from without, the stronger one&apos;s determination to summon forth one&apos;s inner resources to fight against it—this is the spirit of youth.</string>
		<string>It is important to develop your character to be as powerful as a mighty river. Continue to advance bravely in the face of every challenge, paying no heed to the obstacles in your way. Become a great river of bottomless compassion and wisdom, overflowing with boundless invincibility and passion.</string>
		<string>Leaders who are responsible for organizing and holding discussion meetings in the SGI must study. If they do not, they cannot hope to satisfy the participants and inspire them with fresh energy and enthusiasm.</string>
		<string>Young people in school should make study their first priority. It goes without saying that faith is important, but faith is something we practice throughout our entire lives. There is a certain period and age when we should study. If we don&apos;t work hard during that period, we may fail to acquire important knowledge and skills, and we may come to regret it deeply later. Faith manifests itself in daily life. For young people in school, faith manifests itself in their studies. During this period, to devote themselves to study represents an important part of their practice of faith.</string>
		<string>We often hear people say they aren&apos;t capable. But this is a defeatist attitude. If you feel you aren&apos;t capable, then tap into the great reservoir of potential that lies inside you. Since we embrace Nichiren Buddhism, we have recourse to daimoku. If we chant daimoku to the Gohonzon, we can bring forth all the ability and strength we will ever need.</string>
		<string>Freedom doesn&apos;t mean an absence of all restrictions. It means possessing unshakable conviction in the face of any obstacle. This is true freedom.</string>
		<string>Without opposition there is no growth. It is hard to argue with that logic. A state in which we are free from problems or constraints is not happiness. Happiness is transcending all opposition and obstacles and continuing to grow.</string>
		<string>Rather than sitting around idly and rusting, we must act, give of ourselves and contribute something to the world. The French scholar Robert Arnauld (1588–1674) declared, &quot;Have we not all eternity to rest in?&quot; Why do you seek to rest while you are still alive? he asks. These are venerable words indeed. When young people make truly dedicated efforts, almost punishing themselves, their true brilliance will shine forth.</string>
		<string>Youth means to cherish hope; it is a time of development. Youth means to challenge oneself; it is a time of construction. Youth means to fight for justice; it is a time of action.</string>
		<string>Nothing can match the strength of those whose lives have been shaped and forged through challenging and overcoming hardships. Such people fear nothing. The purpose of our Buddhist practice is to develop such strength and fortitude. To cultivate such an invincible core is in itself a victory. It is also the greatest benefit. Those who can succeed in this endeavor will savor unsurpassed happiness; they can manifest the supreme state of Buddhahood.</string>
		<string>I hope you members of the youth division will, in the spirit of Shijo Kingo, advance with Nichiren and also with Mr. Makiguchi, Mr. Toda and myself. This spirit of joint struggle shared by mentor and disciple is the very heart of the SGI. It represents a solidarity in which people are linked by a true unity of purpose and commitment. May each one of you lead the most valuable, meaningful youth. The age belongs to you.</string>
		<string>The Lotus Sutra, which explains that all people can attain Buddhahood and that all people are Buddhas, embodies a spirit of supreme respect for human beings. By contrast, those teachings and ideas that seek to turn people into objects to be exploited embody ultimate disrespect for human beings. Such disrespect is an expression of fundamental darkness. On the level of the individual, practicing the Lotus Sutra means confronting the fundamental darkness in one&apos;s own life.</string>
		<string>One&apos;s true worth as a human being is not a matter of outward appearance or title but derives rather from the breadth of one&apos;s spirit. Everything comes down to faith and conviction. It is what is in one&apos;s heart and the substance of one&apos;s actions that count.</string>
		<string>I hope that each of you will realize success in your respective fields, fully recognizing that success means not giving up halfway but resolutely pursuing the path you have chosen. To this end, it is also important that you realize that the place where you work is a place for forging your character and growing as a human being. By extension, therefore, it is a place for your Buddhist practice, a place for practicing and deepening your faith. When you view things from this angle, all your complaints will disappear. No one is more pathetic than someone who is constantly complaining.</string>
		<string>A nurse who has cared for many terminal patients has observed, &quot;Ultimately, people only die as they have lived.&quot; To die happily is therefore extremely difficult. And since death is the final settlement of accounts for one&apos;s life, it is when our true self comes to the fore. We practice faith to live happily and also to die happily. One who has faith in the Mystic Law will not die an unhappy death.</string>
		<string>Buddhism teaches, through the example of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging, to never look down on anyone. This is the essence of Buddhism. Nichiren states that the &quot;ultimate transmission&quot; of Buddhism is to accord friends and fellow believers who are striving for kosen-rufu the same respect and reverence one would a Buddha.</string>
		<string>How can we create the greatest value in the short span of a lifetime? Those of us who embrace the Mystic Law know the answer. Our faith in and practice of Nichiren Buddhism enable us in this lifetime to solidify the world of Buddhahood in our lives and establish a state of eternal happiness. That is the purpose of faith in the Mystic Law, the purpose of our Buddhist practice.</string>
		<string>Our existence in this world can be likened to a dream. The issue of the greatest importance and eternal relevance is how we face death, the inescapable destiny of all living beings. For in the face of death, external factors such as social status or position in the organization count for naught. Everything depends on one&apos;s faith, one&apos;s state of life.</string>
		<string>When your determination changes, everything else will begin to move in the direction you desire. The moment you resolve to be victorious, every nerve and fiber in your being will immediately orient itself toward your success. On the other hand, if you think &quot;This is never going to work out,&quot; then at that instant every cell in your being will be deflated and give up the fight, and then everything really will move in the direction of failure.</string>
		<string>In the twinkling of an eye we grow old. Our physical strength wanes and we begin to suffer various aches and pains. We practice Nichiren Buddhism so that instead of sinking into feelings of sadness, loneliness and regret, we can greet old age with an inner richness and maturity as round and complete as a ripe, golden fruit of autumn. Faith exists so that we can welcome smiling and without regrets an old age that is like a breathtaking sunset whose dazzling rays color heaven and earth in majestic hues.</string>
		<string>The principle that &quot;Buddhism equals life&quot; means that everything in one&apos;s life is itself Buddhism. The principle that &quot;Buddhism becomes manifest in society&quot; means that society, too, is one with Buddhism. The struggle for kosen-rufu can be waged only within the realities of life and society. Those who earnestly grapple with these realities develop strength and inner substance. They develop and grow.</string>
		<string>Winning in life is not a matter of form or appearances. It has nothing to do with vanity. Victory in life ultimately hinges on whether one has truly fought, whether one has truly advanced.</string>
		<string>What kinds of causes am I making right now?&quot; &quot;What actions am I taking?&quot; The answers to these questions are what will determine our future—in this life and throughout the three existences. Herein lies the foundation of faith. True glory and victory in life lie in basing oneself on this fundamental principle.</string>
		<string>Everything ultimately depends on whether there is someone who is willing to wage a desperate all-out struggle, someone who will take one hundred percent responsibility without relying on or leaving things to others, someone who will work with selfless dedication for the sake of the people without any concern for what others think. Such a person is a true leader and a genuine Buddhist.</string>
		<string>Our voice costs nothing and it is our strongest weapon. Nichiren wrote, &quot;Do not spare your voice&quot; (Gosho Zenshu, p. 726). There are different voices for different situations: the clear, resounding voice that declares truth and justice; the strong voice that refutes evil; the bright, confident voice that tells others about the greatness of this Buddhism; the warm voice that gives encouragement; the sincere, friendly voice that offers praise and words of appreciation to others. The important thing is that we meet and speak with people widely, inside and outside the organization.</string>
		<string>Pioneering takes steady dedicated effort; it is advancing surely one step at a time. True Buddhist practice lies in such activities as visiting members, giving personal encouragement, talking to our friends about Buddhism and introducing others to faith. How many members do you take the time to visit and encourage in a month? In a year? True pioneering lies in making precisely such efforts. Our challenge is to deepen the understanding of friends and fellow members toward the philosophy and activities of the SGI through our encounters with them.</string>
		<string>Faith means making a hundred percent effort ourselves—in our daimoku and in our actions. When we practice in this way, the Buddhist gods will lend us their protection. We mustn&apos;t have a complacent, dependent attitude in faith, chanting haphazardly without definite goals and making only halfhearted efforts in the belief that we&apos;ll automatically be protected. Depth of determination and unshakable character are vital. Those possessing these qualities are second to none in faith.</string>
		<string>Faith, which at first glance may appear weak, is actually the most powerful force in the world. Many people put on a show of being strong, but true strength has nothing to do with appearances On the contrary, we usually find that the weaker the individual, the greater his or her bravado or outward display of strength.</string>
		<string>Those who strengthen their faith day by day and month after month are genuine practitioners. Our daily practice of gongyo, therefore, is important, as well as attending meetings every month. We must not let our faith grow weak. We must make it stronger today than yesterday, stronger this month than last. Buddhist practice is a succession of such untiring efforts, the ultimate goal of which is attaining the summit of Buddhahood.</string>
		<string>I hope that leaders will earnestly pray for the prosperity, safety and happiness of the members who are all so infinitely noble and praiseworthy. May you also never forget to develop yourselves and pray to become people who are liked and trusted by the members, who can work unstintingly for the members&apos; happiness and well-being.</string>
		<string>Please make every effort to find and raise capable people. My wish is that you construct a wonderful organization, joyfully building growing spheres of friendship and a solidarity of people who cherish hope for life and the future. Please lead the most wonderful of lives.</string>
		<string>Never be shaken, no matter what happens or what others may say. Never be flustered; never lose confidence. This is the way we should strive to live our lives. Being able to do so is a sign of genuine character.</string>
		<string>We are people of faith, and faith is the ultimate conviction. Nothing could be sadder nor more shortsighted, therefore, than complaining or giving up when we encounter some small obstacle in our path. A genuine Buddhist is a person of wisdom and conviction.</string>
		<string>Nichiren said to one of his lay followers: &quot;I entrust you with the propagation of Buddhism in your province. Because the seeds of Buddhahood sprout in response to the proper influence, one expounds the teaching of the one vehicle&quot; (MW-5, 151). Forming connections with other human beings is important. For each of us, everything starts with developing ties with others, forging bonds of friendship and winning trust.</string>
		<string>Mr. Toda once told me: &quot;You can make a defeat the cause for future victory. You can also make victory the cause for future defeat.&quot; The Buddhism of Nichiren is the Buddhism of the true cause, the Buddhism of the present and future. We don&apos;t dwell on the past. We are always challenging ourselves from the present toward the future. &quot;The whole future lies ahead of us! We have only just begun!&quot;—because we advance with this spirit, we will never be deadlocked.</string>
		<string>What will the future be like? No one knows the answer to that question. All we know is that the effects that will appear in the future are all contained in the causes that are made in the present. The important thing, therefore, is that we stand up and take action to achieve great objectives without allowing ourselves to be distracted or discouraged by immediate difficulties.</string>
		<string>When you encounter a wall, you should tell yourself, &quot;Since there is a wall here, a wide, open expanse must lie on the other side.&quot; Rather than becoming discouraged, know that encountering a wall is proof of the progress that you have made so far. I hope that you will continually advance in your Buddhist practice with this conviction blazing ever more strongly in your heart.</string>
		<string>There may be times, certainly, when being a member of an organization seems bothersome and we just want to be alone. But how sad it is if we are left alone without any support and then lose our faith. True growth comes from striving together with our fellow members in the living realm of human beings, experiencing the rich gamut of human emotions.</string>
		<string>It doesn&apos;t matter in what area, just keep working on your personal revolution to transform and improve yourself in the way most natural for you. The important thing is that you change in some positive way. There is surely no more exhilarating a life than one in which we write our own unique history of human revolution each day. And the growth and transformation we achieve in this way can convince people of the greatness of Nichiren Buddhism more eloquently than anything else.</string>
		<string>It is important to have a sufficiently elevated life-condition so that you will be able to calmly accept whatever happens in life, striving to put problems into proper perspective and solving them with a positive attitude. Happiness blossoms forth from such a strong and all-encompassing life-condition.</string>
		<string>The Gohonzon encompasses the entire universe. Therefore, we who believe in and chant daimoku to the Gohonzon can live out our lives with the greatest serenity and composure. Please be confident that through faith in the Mystic Law we can definitely lead a wonderful and unsurpassed existence.</string>
		<string>An awareness of death enables us to live each day each moment—filled with appreciation for the unique opportunity we have to create something of our time on earth. I believe that in order to enjoy true happiness, we should live each moment as if it were our last. Today will never return. We may speak of the past or of the future, but the only reality we have is that of this present instant. And confronting the reality of death actually enables us to bring unlimited creativity, courage and joy into each instant of our lives.</string>
		<string>True joy is to be found in working for kosen-rufu, in practicing and taking action for the happiness of oneself and others. The greatest joy in life is to be found in SGI activities. Our activities for kosen-rufu become memories that shine ever more brilliantly in our lives as time goes by.</string>
		<string>There is no need to be impatient. Anything that is accomplished quickly and easily will not long endure. Now is the time to concentrate on the construction of a solid foundation. I hope you will complete this work slowly but surely, filled with hope and joy.</string>
		<string>Intellect will play a very important role in the coming age. By intellect I mean refined wisdom, clear reasoning, profound philosophy and broad-ranging knowledge. We are entering an age when people will develop their intelligence and wisdom, infusing society with their new outlook.</string>
		<string>I hope that each of you will study broadly and develop your understanding of life, society and the universe, based on your faith in Nichiren Buddhism. This type of learning enables you to cultivate a rich state of life, or inner world, drawing forth profound wisdom and limitless leadership ability from the depths of your life.</string>
		<string>A victor is one whose life shines with faith. Emerson, one of the favorite writers of my youth, once said, &quot;That which befits us . . . is cheerfulness and courage, and the endeavor to realize our aspirations.&quot; To advance toward our dreams cheerfully, to courageously work toward achieving them—this is what gives sublime meaning and value to our lives.</string>
		<string>No matter what happens, please continue to chant daimoku—in both good times and bad, irrespective of joys or sorrows, happiness or suffering. Then you will be able to seize victory in your daily life and in society.</string>
		<string>President Toda detested formality. And for this reason, as his disciple, I have tried to place foremost emphasis on substance. Formalities are important in certain cases, but mere formality without substance is evil. Formalities in and of themselves have no life, whereas substance is alive. Formality is provisional and substance essential. Formality is conventional and therefore conservative, but substance provides the impetus for progress and development.</string>
		<string>The mentality of getting others to do the hard work while one sits back and takes it easy—that is bureaucratism at its worst; it is not faith. The spirit of taking on the hard work oneself—that is faith, that is humanism.</string>
		<string>The main point is to enable one member to stand up by imparting heartfelt assurance and understanding. It is the explosion of faith in the microcosm of an individual that causes the macrocosm of the organization—a gathering of many such individuals—to commence its revolution. This is how the doctrine of a life-moment possesses three thousand realms applies to our practice.</string>
		<string>As far as the fundamental teachings of Buddhism and the Gosho are concerned, I hope that, regarding them as absolutely correct, you will first and foremost strive to put them into practice. I urge you to do so because this is the shortest route to understanding the essence of Buddhism in the depths of your life.</string>
		<string>The only way to succeed is by first bringing to completion that which is most immediate. This principle applies in all affairs—in our daily lives, our work and our families as well as in the progress of kosen-rufu.</string>
		<string>It is the sharp sword of the Mystic Law and the great power of faith that enable us to completely sever the chains of suffering. Therefore, I wish to make it clear that to secure eternal freedom and happiness, you must absolutely not be cowardly, especially in faith.</string>
		<string>I hope that, basing yourself on faith, you will become wealthy people of virtue and influence who are widely respected. I would like to add, however, that worldly success is not equivalent to true happiness. Achieving this requires that we have a profound understanding of the nature of life. A person of success in the true sense is one who can enjoy a free and unrestrained state of life.</string>
		<string>Whether we regard difficulties in life as misfortunes or whether we view them as good fortune depends entirely on how much we have forged our inner determination. It all depends on our attitude or inner state of life. With a dauntless spirit, we can lead a cheerful and thoroughly enjoyable life. We can develop a &quot;self&quot; of such fortitude that we can look forward to life&apos;s trials and tribulations with a sense of profound elation and joy: &quot;Come on obstacles! I&apos;ve been expecting you! This is the chance that I&apos;ve been waiting for!&quot;</string>
		<string>It may seem perfectly all right to put ourselves and our own wishes first, to simply follow the dictates of our emotions and cravings, but the truth is that there is nothing more unreliable than our own mind. Life doesn&apos;t always go like clockwork and things will not necessarily turn out as we hope or plan. Consequently, Nichiren frequently stressed: You should become the master of your mind, not let your mind master you. We mustn&apos;t allow ourselves to be ruled by a self-centered mind. Rather, we have to discipline our mind and gain mastery over it. This is Nichiren&apos;s strict admonition.</string>
		<string>Gongyo is a practice that calls forth and activates the infinite power that the microcosm inherently possesses. It transforms your fate, breaks through any apparent dead ends and converts sufferings into happiness. It creates a transformation, a revolution of the microcosm. It is a diagram in miniature of kosen-rufu in our lives.</string>
		<string>Do not compare yourselves to others. Be true to who you are and continue to learn with all your might. Even if you are ridiculed, even if you suffer disappointments and setbacks, continue to advance and do not be defeated.</string>
		<string>It is only natural that sometimes we fall sick. But we must see that sickness as a sickness that originally exists in life, based on the principle of the Mystic Law. In other words, there is no reason to allow yourself to be controlled by illness, for it to fill your life with suffering and distress. From the standpoint of eternal life through the three existences, your fundamentally happy self is incontrovertibly established.</string>
		<string>Nichiren has taught us that through gongyo and chanting daimoku we can reach an elevated state in which, while engaged in our daily lives, we travel throughout the entire universe. When you worship the Gohonzon, the door to your microcosm is opened to the entire universe, the macrocosm, and you experience a great, boundless joy, as if you were looking out over the entire cosmos. You feel great satisfaction and rejoicing, a great wisdom, as if you held the entire universe in your palm.</string>
		<string>There are cases when we wonder why merit doesn&apos;t reveal itself in spite of our earnest and high degree of faith. At such times, rather than suspecting that you may entertain doubt about the Gohonzon, it is better to ask yourself whether you are guilty of a type of slander. Because a person who is contemptuous, hating, jealous or holds grudges will realize no benefits.</string>
		<string>Just as a diamond can only be polished by another diamond, it is only through intense human interaction engaging the entire personality that people can forge themselves, raising themselves up to ever-greater heights.</string>
		<string>The purpose of faith is to become happy. I hope all of you will take this sure path to happiness, never wandering onto byroads that lead to unhappiness. Please walk the great path of kosen-rufu with confidence and pride.</string>
		<string>It is important that we live cheerfully. With a strong spirit of optimism, we need to be able to continually direct our minds in a bright, positive and beneficial direction and help those around us do so, too. We should strive to develop a state of life where we feel a sense of joy no matter what happens.</string>
		<string>To establish meaningful lives, I hope that during your youth you will work hard to polish your intellect. Life, in a sense, is a battle of wisdom. It is the power of Buddhism that enables one to win this battle. True faith is characterized by a brilliance of intellect and depth of wisdom that result from devotion to practice.</string>
		<string>Throughout his life, Shakyamuni encouraged people with his clear, sonorous voice. A Buddhist text describes how Shakyamuni warmheartedly welcomed everyone he met, expressing his joy at seeing them. He showed affection, joy and gentleness in all his interactions. He greeted everyone with courtesy and respect. He never scowled or grimaced. And to put others at ease and encourage them to speak up, Shakyamuni would always break the ice by initiating the conversation. It was the power of Shakyamuni&apos;s eloquence and sincerity that made it possible for Buddhism to gain wide acceptance among the people of his time.</string>
		<string>In the &quot;Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings,&quot; Nichiren says with reference to attaining Buddhahood, &quot;&apos;To attain&apos; means &apos;to open&apos;&quot; (Gosho Zenshu, p. 753). Attaining Buddhahood means opening our lives to their fullest potential and revealing our innate Buddhahood. This is the purpose of Buddhism.</string>
		<string>Nichiren explains the significance of cause and effect: All sutras other than the Lotus Sutra expound that Buddhahood (effect), can be attained only after having made good causes, that is, practicing their teachings (causes), over a length of time. With the Lotus Sutra, however, the very act of embracing it (cause) enables one simultaneously to become a Buddha (effect).</string>
		<string>There are various kinds of careers and roles that people fill in society. While each role of course has significance, the fundamental role that we each play as a Buddhist is that of philosopher of life and of humanity who can impart eternal value to humankind. We are leaders of happiness and creators of peace. In this sense, our role is unique.</string>
		<string>The twentieth century was a century of war and peace, a century of politics and economics. The dawning twenty-first century holds the promise, however, to be a century of humanity and culture, a century of science and religion. I hope all of you will advance on this wonderful new path of humanism with pride and confidence, as gallant philosophers of action.</string>
		<string>I hope that no matter what happens, you will always advance with hope. Especially I hope that the more desperate your circumstances, the more you will press on with unflagging hope. Please keep challenging things with a bright and positive spirit, always taking care at the same time to safeguard your health.</string>
		<string>Buddhism aims to make people free in the most profound sense; its purpose is not to restrict or constrain. Doing gongyo is a right, not an obligation. Because Buddhism entails practice, tenacious efforts are required, but these are all for your own sake. If you want to have great benefits or to develop a profound state of life, you should exert yourself accordingly.</string>
		<string>There are many people, many lives, on this planet, too numerous, in fact, to count. From this great multitude, we wondrously find ourselves together with those in our families— as parents and children, as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives. If we do not live joyfully and cheerfully in the company of those with whom we share this profound bond, what is life for? Should the atmosphere at home be somber, you yourself can be the &quot;sun.&quot; By being a shining presence, you can cast the light of hope on your father, mother and whole family.</string>
		<string>Please steadily advance along the fundamental path of &quot;faith manifests itself in daily life,&quot; living in the way that best suits you. Just as the sun rises every day, if you persistently advance based on the Mystic Law, the absolute Law of the universe, you will definitely be able to lead a life in which all desires are fulfilled, a life that you cannot now even conceive of. Please be convinced that you are now leading the most certain and valuable life.</string>
		<string>When we speak of showing actual proof, it doesn&apos;t mean we have to try to put on a show of being in any way more knowledgeable or accomplished than we are. It is my hope that, in the manner that best suits your situation, you will prove the validity of this Buddhism by steadily improving in your daily life and in polishing your character, as well as in your family, place of work and community.</string>
		<string>Only if you challenge your human revolution in a manner that is true to yourself will the people around you naturally begin to trust and respect you. That in itself is the greatest way of laying the groundwork for the spread of Nichiren Buddhism.</string>
		<string>Nichiren Buddhism is concerned with a very practical problem—how people should live their lives—and never for an instant allows its attention to be diverted from that problem. And because this is its purpose, it demands as a first step that one conduct a thorough and fearless examination into the true nature of human life.</string>
		<string>The innate power of humanity is the driving force that breaks down all barriers of discrimination. The ultimate expression of this humanity is Buddhahood; it is the power of the Mystic Law. Daimoku is therefore the fundamental energy for realizing victory in the struggle for human rights.</string>
		<string>What is the purpose of life? It is happiness. But there are two kinds of happiness: relative and absolute. Relative happiness comes in a wide variety of forms. The purpose of Buddhism is to attain Buddhahood. In modern terms, this could be explained as realizing absolute happiness—a state of happiness that can never be destroyed or defeated.</string>
		<string>If you practice faith while doubting its effects, you will get results that are at best unsatisfactory. This is the reflection of your own weak faith on the mirror of the cosmos. On the other hand, when you stand up with strong confidence, you will accrue limitless blessings.</string>
		<string>There is a Russian proverb that says: &quot;It is no use to blame the looking glass if your face is awry.&quot; Likewise, one&apos;s happiness or unhappiness is entirely the reflection of the balance of good and bad causes accumulated in one&apos;s life. No one can blame others for his misfortunes. In the world of faith, it is necessary to realize this all the more clearly.</string>
		<string>If I were to make an analogy, thought and philosophy would be like the heart or respiratory system of the human body. When the heart is sound, the whole body can maintain healthy activity. This same principle applies to both the individual and society. The SGI has a mission to serve as the heart that ensures the healthy functioning of society. Consequently, taking good care of the SGI (the heart) allows the fresh life-giving blood of humanism to flow to and nourish all areas of society, including culture, politics and the economy.</string>
		<string>Rosa Parks wrote in her book Quiet Strength: &quot;I find that if I am thinking too much of my own problems and the fact that at times things are not just like I want them to be, I do not make any progress at all. But if I look around and see what I can do, and then I do it, I move on.&quot; Youth, and indeed life itself, flashes by in the blink of an eye. That is why it is important for you young people to ask yourselves what you can do for those who are suffering, what you can do to resolve the contradictions that plague society and to boldly take on these great challenges.</string>
		<string>Please do not forget your mother&apos;s love or the hardships she has endured for you. I am convinced that while people keep the memory of their mothers&apos; loving faces alive in their minds, they will never go far astray. Similarly, as long as we bear in mind Nichiren&apos;s profound compassion and live in deep appreciation of it, our lives will be illuminated brightly by the light of Buddhahood. And enveloped in the Gohonzon&apos;s great compassion, we will walk along a path that is filled with tranquillity and immeasurable joy.</string>
		<string>You cannot judge the quality of another&apos;s friendship by superficial appearances, especially when things are going smoothly. It is only when we have experienced the worst, most crushing of times—when we have plumbed the depths of life—that we can experience the joys of genuine friendship. Only a man of principle, a woman of resolve—a person who stays true to their chosen path—can be a trusted and true friend, and have real friends in turn.</string>
		<string>Faith is the ultimate essence of intellect. Through the practice of correct faith, the intellect comes to shine. Intellect without correct faith lacks a firm anchor in the soil of life and eventually becomes disordered. This prompted the first Soka Gakkai president, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, to remark that many modern thinkers were suffering from what he termed &quot;higher psychosis.&quot; Faith without intellect, meanwhile, leads to blind faith and fanaticism. Faith or intellect alone—one without the other—is unhealthy.</string>
		<string>Happiness doesn&apos;t exist on the far side of distant mountains. It is within you, yourself. Not you, however, sitting in idle passivity. It is to be found in the vibrant dynamism of your own life as you struggle to challenge and overcome one obstacle after another, as you clamber up a perilous ridge in pursuit of that which lies beyond.</string>
		<string>Compassion is the very soul of Buddhism. To pray for others, making their problems and anguish our own; to embrace those who are suffering, becoming their greatest ally; to continue giving them our support and encouragement until they become truly happy—it is in such humanistic actions that Nichiren Buddhism lives and breathes.</string>
		<string>President Toda often said: &quot;Those of you who have problems or sufferings, pray earnestly! Buddhism is a deadly serious win-or-lose struggle. If you should [pray with such an earnest attitude] and still have no solution forthcoming, then I will give you my life!&quot; This invincible conviction on which Mr. Toda was willing to stake his life inspired the members.</string>
		<string>Buddhism means putting the teachings into practice. Practice equals faith. With sincere prayer and action, our desires cannot possibly fail to be fulfilled. When you continue to apply yourselves to your Buddhist practice toward kosen-rufu, solidifying and gaining mastery in your faith, you will find that all your prayers will definitely be answered.</string>
		<string>Nichiren writes, &quot;If you light a lantern for another, it will also brighten your own way&quot; (Gosho Zenshu, p. 1598). Please be confident that the higher your flame of altruistic action burns, the more its light will suffuse your life with happiness. Those who possess an altruistic spirit are the happiest people of all.</string>
		<string>Faith is the secret to happiness for all people. When you truly forge your mind of faith, you will become an eternal victor throughout the three existences of past, present and future. Strong faith enables you to display your wisdom appropriately, so that you can take advantage of change and move forward in the direction of victory and hope.</string>
		<string>In any earnest struggle, there come crucial challenges—mountains that must be scaled and conquered if we are to win. In Buddhist practice, too, we face such crucial challenges. If we hope to advance kosen-rufu and attain Buddhahood, then we must prevail over these mountains.</string>
		<string>If you practice faith yet have an attitude of complaint, you will destroy your good fortune in direct proportion. Those who are full of complaint are not respected by others. From both Buddhist and secular perspectives, their behavior does not befit a wise or worthy person.</string>
		<string>Where can we find the royal road to reformation and change? Emerson declared: &quot;Not he is great who can alter matter, but he who can alter my state of mind.&quot; He strongly urged us to undergo an inner reformation. I want you to be assured that the challenge to which we set ourselves day after day—that of our human revolution—is the royal road to bringing about a reformation in our families, local regions and societies. An inner revolution is the most fundamental and at the same time the ultimate revolution for engendering change in all things.</string>
		<string>It is our hearts that change others&apos; hearts. Friendship changes people. Travelers who pull their capes over their shoulders and brace themselves determinedly against the cold wind naturally relax and change their outlook and actions when warmed by the sun.</string>
		<string>Joy is not simply your personal, egoistic happiness. Nor is it making others happy at the expense of your own happiness. You and others delighting together, you and others becoming happy together—this is the Mystic Law and the wondrous thing about our realm of kosen-rufu. Nichiren states, &quot;Joy means that both oneself and others have wisdom and compassion&quot; (Gosho Zenshu, p. 761).</string>
		<string>Faith means infinite hope, and infinite hope resides in the SGI. As long as your faith is sincere, infinite glory, boundless good fortune and endless victory will unfold before you. You will never find yourselves at a dead end.</string>
		<string>We must put down firm roots; we must be strong. Inner strength is a prerequisite for happiness, a prerequisite for upholding justice and one&apos;s beliefs. One of the Buddha&apos;s titles is &quot;He Who Can Forbear.&quot; To courageously endure, persevere and overcome all difficulties—the Buddha is the ultimate embodiment of the virtue of forbearance. The power of faith gives us the strength to weather and survive any storm. Perseverance is the essence of a Buddha.</string>
		<string>President Toda used to say, &quot;Become individuals who are strong physically, intellectually and spiritually.&quot; To be strong in all three areas is the ideal. Many people may be strong in one or two of these areas, but only when all three are combined can we enjoy a well-balanced life, a life of resounding victory. Those who cultivate such all-around strength are never defeated.</string>
		<string>When we are aware that each moment of each day, each gesture and step we take, is truly mystical and full of wonder, we will live our lives with greater thought and care. We will also have greater respect and appreciation for the lives of others.</string>
		<string>The organization of faith is not something that holds you back or restricts you. Rather, it is a springboard that enables you to develop yourself to the utmost and to lead the most dynamic existence. It is the most precious place for carrying out our Buddhist practice.</string>
		<string>Faith manifests itself as wisdom. The purpose of our faith is to become wise, so that we can live wisely. The desire to save others becomes merely an abstract goal if those who practice faith cannot communicate with their own children nor build strong and happy families.</string>
		<string>The good fortune that accrues to parents who apply themselves diligently to SGI activities will protect their children without fail. Based on this conviction, you must still make positive efforts to open and sustain dialogue with your children, not allowing yourselves to neglect them, claiming that you&apos;re too busy or it can&apos;t be helped, or telling yourselves that somehow things will be taken care of. Unless you exert yourselves in this way, you are irresponsible parents who lack compassion.</string>
		<string>Outward appearance is not important—what counts is what is inside our hearts. Are there heart-to-heart bonds? Some families may always be together physically but are estranged at heart. Some families can only get together for brief periods but manage to enjoy concentrated and lively heart-to-heart communication when they do meet. Families that share bonds of closeness based on day-to-day efforts are ones in which the members feel comfortable and at ease with one another, no matter where they are or what they&apos;re doing.</string>
		<string>We are all human beings; in that regard, we are all the same. The only real difference lies in people&apos;s life-conditions. Our life-condition continues beyond death into eternity. Therefore, as Nichiren says, &quot;Faith alone is what really matters.&quot;</string>
		<string>We SGI members devote ourselves to serving the Law, serving humanity. Ours is not an egocentric life. That is why we are busier than others and perhaps don&apos;t have as much opportunity for relaxation with our families. Nevertheless, we continue to devote ourselves to others. Ours is the most noble way of life. We must make sure our children can understand and respect our beliefs, our way of life and our dedication. We must make conscious efforts to verbalize and communicate our thoughts and feelings to them. Finding the wisdom for this task is an expression of our faith.</string>
		<string>Encouragement—offering encouraging words—is important. Nichiren states, &quot;The voice does the Buddha&apos;s work&quot; (Gosho Zenshu, p. 708). Sincere words of encouragement have the power to give people hope and courage to go on living.</string>
		<string>President Toda used to say: &quot;Don&apos;t be impatient. Since you have embraced the Gohonzon, your situation will definitely improve. There&apos;s no need to worry. Sure there will be hard times, times when you feel like crying. But as long as you have the Gohonzon, your life will become bright and joyful.&quot; As long as we persevere in faith, we will become happy. We must never doubt this no matter what happens but always advance resolutely, staunchly enduring all hardships and obstacles along the way. This is what true faith is.</string>
		<string>Buddhism holds that everything is in a constant state of flux. Thus the question is whether we are to accept change passively and be swept away by it or whether we are to take the lead and create positive changes on our own initiative. While conservatism and self-protection might be likened to winter, night and death, the spirit of pioneering and attempting to realize ideals evokes images of spring, morning and birth.</string>
		<string>Our lives are infinitely precious. To not attain a state of absolute happiness in this lifetime is a great loss. Our Buddhist practice exists so that we can attain indestructible happiness. We must fight to the fullest right now, not sometime in the future.</string>
		<string>Leo Tolstoy concluded that the only way to bring about a fundamental change in society is to realize a change in public opinion, a change in people&apos;s minds. Then how can we change public opinion? Tolstoy asserted: &quot;It is only necessary for people to say what they really think or at least to refrain from saying what they do not think.&quot; It is vital, in other words, not to be swayed by others&apos; opinions or past ways of thinking or doing. Instead each of us must become wise, possessing our own firm convictions.</string>
		<string>Many religions have demanded blind faith, taking away people&apos;s independence. President Makiguchi opposed such enslavement. What he called for instead was solidarity of awakened common people. To achieve this, he proposed a self-reliant way of life in which we advance on the path of our choice with a firm, independent character. He also stressed a contributive way of life in which we set our fundamental goal in life toward the realization of happiness for ourselves and others, casting aside arrogance and self-satisfaction to respect and benefit others.</string>
		<string>If a person is hungry, we should give them bread. When there is no bread, we can at least give words that nourish. To a person who looks ill or is physically frail, we can turn the conversation to some subject that will lift their spirits and fill them with the hope and determination to get better. Let us give something to each person we meet: joy, courage, hope, assurance, philosophy, wisdom, a vision for the future. Let us always give something.</string>
		<string>Good health equals Buddhism. Daily life equals faith. Taking care to avoid traffic accidents and making efforts to stay in good health, therefore, are all part of our Buddhist practice. It is important that we live wisely, striving with the awareness each day that all the actions and activities we undertake for the sake of faith contribute to our good health and well-being.</string>
		<string>No matter what the circumstances, you should never concede defeat. Never conclude that you&apos;ve reached a dead end, that everything is finished. You possess a glorious future. And precisely because of that, you must persevere and study. Life is eternal. We need to focus on the two existences of the present and the future and not get caught up in the past. We must always have the spirit to begin anew &quot;from this moment,&quot; to initiate a new struggle each day.</string>
		<string>Kosen-rufu is a very long struggle. It is a march that will continue over the ten thousand years of the Latter Day of the Law. Therefore, let us advance joyfully and unhurriedly. Activities must not be conducted in such a way that people suffer and become exhausted. Meetings should be short and not too numerous and conducted so that they are valuable and productive for all concerned.</string>
		<string>Who is truly great? I hope you can develop the ability to discern true human greatness. A great person is someone who forges unity among human beings through sincere dialogue, armed with a solid philosophy, feet firmly planted on the ground. A great person is one who lives among the people and earns their unshakable trust. Fickle popularity and temporary fads are nothing but illusions.</string>
		<string>Taking good care of our health is most important. In particular, it is vital for those who are advanced in years to get sufficient rest to avoid becoming fatigued. Sleep is the best medicine. I also hope you will put your wisdom to work and find various ways to improve and maintain your health.</string>
		<string>To lead a life in which we are inspired and can inspire others, our hearts have to be alive; they have to be filled with passion and enthusiasm. To achieve that, as President Toda also said, we need the courage to &quot;live true to ourselves.&quot; And to live true to ourselves, we need the strength of mind not to be swayed by our environment or be obsessed with vanity and superficial appearances. Rather than borrowing from or imitating others, we need the conviction to be able to think for ourselves and to take action from our own sense of responsibility.</string>

		<string>New Year&apos;s Day marks the first day, the first month, the beginning of the year, and the start of spring. A person who celebrates this day will accumulate virtue and be loved by all, just as the moon becomes full gradually, moving from west to east, and as the sun shines more brightly, traveling from east to west.</string>
		<string>You must not spend your lives in vain and regret it for ten thousand years to come.</string>
		<string>Just as flowers open up and bear fruit, just as the moon appears and invariably grows full, just as a lamp becomes brighter when oil is added, and just as plants and trees flourish with rain, so will human beings never fail to prosper when they make good causes.</string>
		<string>No matter what, strive in faith and be known as a votary of the Lotus Sutra, and remain my disciple for the rest of your life.</string>
		<string>The sincerity of making offerings to the Lotus Sutra at the beginning of the New Year is like cherry blossoms blooming from trees, a lotus unfolding in a pond, sandalwood leaves unfurling on the Snow Mountains, or the moon beginning to rise.</string>
		<string>This means that anyone who teaches others even a single phrase of the Lotus Sutra is the envoy of the Thus Come One, whether that person be priest or layman, nun or laywoman.</string>
		<string>A sword is useless in the hands of a coward. The mighty sword of the Lotus Sutra must be wielded by one courageous in faith. Then one will be as strong as a demon armed with an iron staff.</string>
		<string>The currents of hardship pour into the sea of the Lotus Sutra and rush against its votary. The river is not rejected by the ocean; nor does the votary reject suffering.</string>
		<string>In judging the relative merit of Buddhist doctrines, I, Nichiren, believe that the best standards are those of reason and documentary proof. And even more valuable than reason and documentary proof is the proof of actual fact.</string>
		<string>Environment is like the shadow, and life, the body. Without the body, no shadow can exist, and without life, no environment.</string>
		<string>If a person cannot manage to cross a moat ten feet wide, how can he cross one that is a hundred or two hundred feet?</string>
		<string>From the time that I was born until today, I have never known a moment&apos;s ease; I have thought only of propagating the daimoku of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>Even a word or a phrase of the correct teaching will enable one to gain the way, if it suits the times and the capacity of the people. But though one studies a thousand sutras and ten thousand treatises, one will not attain Buddhahood if these teachings are unsuitable for the time and the people&apos;s capacity.</string>
		<string>No matter how honest and upright you may be, or how you may strive to be known as a worthy person in the secular or the religious world, if you associate with evil persons, then as a natural result you will find that in two or three instances out of ten you are following their teachings, and in the end you, too, will become an evil person.</string>
		<string>No place is secure. Be convinced that Buddhahood is the final abode.</string>
		<string>Buddhism is reason. Reason will win over your lord.</string>
		<string>It is rare to be born a human being. The number of those endowed with human life is as small as the amount of earth one can place on a fingernail. Life as a human being is hard to sustain — as hard as it is for the dew to remain on the grass.</string>
		<string>This sutra is superior to all other sutras. It is like the lion king, the monarch of all the creatures that run on the ground, and like the eagle, the king of all creatures that fly in the sky.</string>
		<string>Mugwort that grows in the midst of hemp, or a snake inside a tube [will as a matter of course become straight], and those who associate with people of good character will consequently become upright in heart, deed, and word.</string>
		<string>If you do not question and resolve your doubts, you cannot dispel the dark clouds of illusion, any more than you could travel a thousand miles without legs.</string>
		<string>Restraining those who slander the Law and respecting the followers of the correct way will assure stability within the nation and peace in the world at large.</string>
		<string>I say all this solely for the sake of the nation, for the sake of the Law, for the sake of others, not for my own sake.</string>
		<string>More valuable than treasures in a storehouse are the treasures of the body, and the treasures of the heart are the most valuable of all. From the time you read this letter on, strive to accumulate the treasures of the heart!</string>
		<string>Iron, when heated in the flames and pounded, becomes a fine sword, Worthies and sages are tested by abuse.</string>
		<string>To accept is easy; to continue is difficult. But Buddhahood lies in continuing faith.</string>
		<string>If you care anything about your personal security, you should first of all pray for order and tranquillity throughout the four quarters of the land, should you not?</string>
		<string>Everything has its essential point, and the heart of the Lotus Sutra is its title, or the daimoku, of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. Truly, if you chant this in the morning and evening, you are correctly reading the entire Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>Muster your faith, and pray to this Gohonzon. Then what is there that cannot be achieved?</string>
		<string>The Buddha wrote that one should become the master of one&apos;s mind rather than let one&apos;s mind master oneself. This is what I mean when I emphatically urge you to give up even your body, and never begrudge even your life for the sake of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>The mutual possession of the Ten Worlds is as difficult to believe as fire existing in a stone or flowers within a tree. Yet under the right conditions such phenomena actually occur and are believable.</string>
		<string>Our teacher, the Thus Come One Shakyamuni, practised shakubuku during the last eight years of his lifetime, the Great Teacher T&apos;ien-t&apos;ai for more than thirty years, and the Great Teacher Dengyo for more than twenty. I have been refuting the provisional doctrines for more than twenty years, and the great persecutions I have suffered during this period are beyond number.</string>
		<string>Life at each moment … Nevertheless, even though you chant and believe in Myoho-renge-kyo, if you think the Law is outside yourself, you are embracing not the Mystic Law but an inferior teaching.</string>
		<string>The people of today all turn their backs upon what is right; to a person, they give allegiance to evil. This is the reason that the benevolent deities have abandoned the nation and departed together, that sages leave and do not return. And in their stead devils and demons come, and disasters and calamities occur.</string>
		<string>The greater the hardship befalling him, the greater the delight he feels, because of his strong faith.</string>
		<string>But it is better to live a single day with honour than to live to 120 and die in disgrace.</string>
		<string>So day and night I ponder the important doctrines, and hour by hour, moment by moment, I savour the principle that allows us to attain Buddhahood. And because I pass the time in this fashion, though months and years go by, it does not seem long at all, and the hours that have elapsed do not seem like many.</string>
		<string>Be deeply convinced, then, that your illness cannot possibly persist, and that your life cannot fail to be extended! Take care of yourself, and do not burden your mind with grief.</string>
		<string>If you are of the same mind as Nichiren, you must be a Bodhisattva of the Earth.</string>
		<string>No matter how dearly you may cherish your estate, when you die, it will only fall into the hands of others.</string>
		<string>Both teacher and followers will surely fall into the hell of incessant suffering if they see enemies of the Lotus Sutra but disregard them and fail to reproach them.</string>
		<string>Those who become Nichiren&apos;s disciples and lay believers should realise the profound karmic relationship they share with him and spread the Lotus Sutra as he does.</string>
		<string>If the spirit of many in body but one in mind prevails among the people, they will achieve all their goals, whereas if one in body but different in mind, they can achieve nothing remarkable.</string>
		<string>Therefore, the best way to attain Buddhahood is to encounter a good friend. How far can our wisdom take us? If we have even enough wisdom to distinguish hot from cold, we should seek out a good friend.</string>
		<string>What ones has done for another yesterday will be done for oneself today. Blossoms turn into fruit, and brides become mothers-in-law. Chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, and be always diligent in your faith.</string>
		<string>As you crave food when hungry, seek water when thirsty, long to see a lover, beg for medicine when ill, or was a beautiful woman desires powder and rouge, so should you put our faith in the Lotus Sutra. If you do not, you will regret it later.</string>
		<string>If you wish to free yourself from the sufferings of birth and death you have endured since time without beginning and to attain without fail unsurpassed enlightenment in this lifetime, you must perceive the mystic truth that is originally inherent in all living beings. This truth is Myoho-renge-kyo. Chanting Myoho-renge-kyo will therefore enable you to grasp the mystic truth innate in all life.</string>
		<string>If Nichiren&apos;s compassion is truly great and encompassing, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo will spread for ten thousand years and more, for all eternity.</string>
		<string>The Buddha says that life is something that cannot be purchased even for the price of an entire major world system.</string>
		<string>Although parents may give birth to a child who is endowed with both sight and hearing, if there is no teacher to instruct that child, then its eyes and ears will be no better than those of an animal.</string>
		<string>Though the embankment between rice fields is firm, if there is an ant hole in it, then surely, in the long run, it will not remain full of water. Bail the sea water of slander and disbelief out of the ship of your life, and solidify the embankments of your faith.</string>
		<string>The fact that her prayers have gone unanswered is like a strong bow with a weak bowstring, or a fine sword in the hands of a coward. It is no sense the fault of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>If a commanding general is faint-hearted, his soldiers will become cowards. If a bow is weak, the bowstring will be slack. If the wind is gentle, the waves will never rise high. This all accords with the principles of nature.</string>
		<string>Those who believe in the Lotus Sutra are as if in winter, but winter always turns to spring. Never, from ancient times on, has anyone heard or seen of winter turning back to autumn. Not have we ever heard of a believer in the Lotus Sutra who turned into an ordinary person.</string>
		<string>Each of you should summon up the courage of a lion king and never succumb to threats from anyone. The lion king fears no other beast, nor do its cubs. Slanderers are like barking foxes, but Nichiren&apos;s followers are like roaring lions.</string>
		<string>Great events never have minor omens. When great evil occurs, great good follows. Since great slander already exists in our land, the great correct Law will spread without fail. What could any of you have to lament?</string>
		<string>The heart of strategy and swordsmanship derives from the Mystic Law. Have profound faith. A coward cannot have any of his prayers answered.</string>
		<string>If the embankments around a moat do not leak, then the water will never escape from the moat. And if the mind of faith is perfect, then the water of wisdom, the great impartial wisdom, will never dry up.</string>
		<string>Since childhood, I, Nichiren, have never prayed for the secular things of this life but have single-mindedly sought to become a Buddha.</string>
		<string>There is no true happiness other than upholding faith in the Lotus Sutra. This is what is meant by &quot;peace and security in their present existence and good circumstances in future existences.&quot;</string>
		<string>Even if one must give up one&apos;s life, one should not conceal the correct teaching; this is because one&apos;s body is insignificant while the Law is supreme. Though one&apos;s body be destroyed, one should strive to propagate the Law.</string>
		<string>Strengthen your faith day by day and month after month. Should you slacken in your resolve even a bit, devils will take advantage.</string>
		<string>Myo means to be fully endowed, which in turn has the meaning of &quot;perfect and full.&quot;</string>
		<string>Whether you chant the Buddha&apos;s name, recite the sutra, or merely offer flowers and incense, all your virtuous acts will implant benefits and roots of goodness in your life. With this conviction you should strive in faith.</string>
		<string>Though worldly troubles may arise, never let them disturb you. No one can avoid problems, not even sages or worthies. Drink saké only at home with your wife, and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.</string>
		<string>Arouse strong faith, and do not heed what they say. It is the way of the great devil to assume the form of a venerable monk or take possession of one&apos;s father, mother, or brother in order to obstruct happiness in one&apos;s next life. Whatever they may say, however cleverly they may try to deceive you into discarding the Lotus Sutra, do not assent to it.</string>
		<string>The lion king is said to advance three steps, then gather himself to spring, unleashing the same power whether he traps a tiny any or attacks a fierce animal. In inscribing this Gohonzon for her protection, Nichiren was like the lion king. This is what the sutra means by &quot;the power [of the Buddhas] that has the lion&apos;s ferocity.&quot;</string>
		<string>And could not this illness of your husband&apos;s be the Buddha&apos;s design, because the Vimalakirti and Nirvana sutras both teach that sick people will surely attain Buddhahood? Illness gives rise to the resolve to attain the way.</string>
		<string>Having received life, one cannot escape death. Yet though everyone, from the noblest, the emperor, on down to the lowliest commoner, recognises this as a fact, not even one person in a thousand or ten thousand truly takes the matter seriously or grieves over it.</string>
		<string>Were it not for the flowing rivers, there would be no sea. Likewise, without tribulation there would be no votary of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>When praised, one does not consider one&apos;s personal risk, and when criticised, one can recklessly cause one&apos;s own ruin. Such is the way of common mortals.</string>
		<string>The Nirvana Sutra reads: &quot;There are three types of people whose illness is extremely difficult to cure. The first is those who slander the great vehicle; the second, those who commit the five cardinal sins; and the third, icchantikas, or persons of incorrigible disbelief. These three categories of illness are the gravest in the world.&quot;</string>
		<string>It is the heart that is important. No matter how earnestly Nichiren prays for you, if you lack faith, it will be like trying to set fire to wet tinder. Spur yourself to muster the power of faith.</string>
		<string>Though one may perform meritorious deeds, if they are directed towards what is untrue, then those deeds may bring great evil, but they will never result in good. On the other hand, though one may be ignorant and make meagre offerings, if one presents those offerings to a person who upholds the truth, one&apos;s merit will be great. How much more so in the case of people who in all sincerity make offerings to the correct teaching!</string>
		<string>Regard your service to your lord as the practice of the Lotus Sutra. This is what is meant by &quot;No worldly affairs of like or work are ever contrary to the true reality.&quot;</string>
		<string>Carry through with your faith in the Lotus Sutra. You cannot strike fire from flint if you stop halfway. Bring forth the great power of faith, and be spoken of by all the people of Kamakura, both high and low, or by all the people of Japan, as &quot;Shijo Kingo of the Lotus school!&quot;</string>
		<string>Life is limited; we must not begrudge it. What we should ultimately aspire to is the Buddha land.</string>
		<string>At present the entire body of the Honourable Abutsu is composed of the five elements of earth, water, fire, wind, and space. These five elements are also the five characters of the daimoku. Abutsu-bo is therefore the treasure tower itself, and the treasure tower is Abutsu-bo himself.</string>
		<string>Whenever you were persecuted, you backslid and ceased to live by the sutra. That is like boiling water only to pour it into cold water, or like trying to strike fire by giving up halfway, Each and every one of you should be certain deep in your heart that sacrificing your life for the Lotus Sutra is like exchanging rocks for gold or dung for rice.</string>
		<string>If the minds of living beings are impure, their land is also impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their land. There are no two lands, pure or impure in themselves. The difference lies solely in the good or evil of our minds.</string>
		<string>Now if all the four kinds of Buddhists within the four seas and the ten thousand lands would only cease giving alms to wicked priests and instead all come over to the side of the good, then how could any more troubles rise to plague us, or disasters come to confront us?</string>
		<string>The purpose of the appearance in this world of Shakyamuni Buddha, the lord of teachings, lies in his behaviour as a human being. The wise may be called human, but the thoughtless are no more than animals.</string>
		<string>Suffer what there is to suffer, enjoy what there is to enjoy. Regard both suffering and joy as facts of life, and continue chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, no matter what happens.</string>
		<string>Concerning prayer, there are conspicuous prayer and conspicuous response, conspicuous prayer and inconspicuous response, inconspicuous prayer and inconspicuous response, and inconspicuous prayer and conspicuous response. But the only essential point is that, if you believe in this sutra, all your desires will be fulfilled in both the present and the future.</string>
		<string>It is written that those who embrace the daimoku of the Lotus Sutra will be protected by the Mother of Demon Children and by the ten demon daughters. Such persons will enjoy the happiness of the wisdom king Craving-Filled and the good fortune of the heavenly king Vaishravana. Wherever your daughter may frolic or play, not harm will come to her; she will move about without fear like the lion king. Among the ten demon daughters, the protection of Kunti is the most profound. But your faith alone will determine all these things.</string>
		<string>Although I and my disciples may encounter various difficulties, if we do not harbour doubts in our hearts, we will as a matter of course attain Buddhahood. Do not have doubts simply because heaven does not lend you protection. Do not be discouraged because you do not enjoy an easy and secure existence in this life. This is what I have taught my disciples morning and evening, and yet they begin to harbour doubts and abandon their faith.</string>
		<string>The Lotus Sutra is like the lion king, who rules over all other animals. A woman who embraces the lion king of the Lotus Sutra never fears any of the beasts of hell or of the realms of hungry spirits and animals.</string>
		<string>The great ocean contains all the numerous rivers that flow into it, the great earth contains all sentient and insentient beings, the wish-granting jewel is capable of showering down innumerable treasures, and the heavenly king Brahma rules over all the threefold world. The five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo are comparable to these. All beings of the nine worlds, as well as those in the world of Buddhahood, are contained within them.</string>
		<string>All the more fortunate is a case like yours, in which both wife and husband have faith! It is like a bird possessing two wings, or a cart having two wheels. What is there that you two cannot achieve? Because there is a heaven and an earth, a sun and a moon, the sun shines and the rain falls, and the plants and trees of benefit will surely blossom and bear fruit.</string>
		<string>Therefore, knowing that the Lotus Sutra says, &quot;It will face much hostility in the world and be difficult to believe,&quot; how can you retain even a trace of disbelief; and when it says, &quot;Such a person assuredly and without doubt will attain the Buddha way,&quot; how can you refuse to become a Buddha?</string>
		<string>Nichiren&apos;s disciples cannot accomplish anything if they are cowardly.</string>
		<string>&quot;There are six causes of illness: (1) disharmony of the four elements; (2) improper eating or drinking; (3) inappropriate practice of seated meditation; (4) attack by demons; (5) the work of devils; and (6) the effect of karma.&quot;</string>
		<string>How wonderful then is your having wholeheartedly supported the votary of the Lotus Sutra over the years! According to the Buddha&apos;s golden words, in the next life you are certain to be reborn in the pure land of Eagle Peak. What remarkable rewards you will gain!</string>
		<string>I, Nichiren, say that &apos;single&apos; stand for Myo, or mystic, &apos;mind&apos; for ho, or law, &apos;desiring&apos; for ren, or lotus, &apos;see&apos; ge, or flower, and &apos;Buddha&apos; for kyo, or sutra. In propagating these five character, practitioners should &apos;not hesitate even if it costs them their lives&apos;.</string>
		<string>If people favour what is only incidental and forget what is primary, can the benevolent deities be anything but angry? If people cast aside what is perfect and take up what is biased, can the world escape the plots of demons?</string>
		<string>One who listen to even a sentence or phrase of the sutra and cherishes it deep in one&apos;s heart may be likened to a ship that crosses the sea of the sufferings of birth and death.</string>
		<string>All of these abuse were incurred because of the Lotus Sutra, and they are therefore no shame to the men who suffered them. To be praised by fools - that is the greatest shame.</string>
		<string>Teaching another something is the same as oiling the wheels of a cart so that they turn even though it is heavy, or as floating a boat on water so that it moves ahead easily. The way to become a Buddha easily is nothing special. It is the same is giving water to a thirsty person in a time of drought, or as providing fire for a person freezing in the cold. Or again, it is the same as giving another something that is one of a kind, or as offering something as alms to another even at the risk of one&apos;s life.</string>
		<string>Though this mandala has but five or seven characters, it is the teacher of all Buddhas throughout the three existences and the seal that guarantees the enlightenment of all women. It will be a lamp in the darkness of the road to the next world and a fine horse to carry you over the mountains of death. It is like the sun and moon in the heavens or Mt Sumeru on earth. It is a ship to ferry people over the sea of the sufferings of birth and death. It is teacher who leads all people to Buddhahood and enlightenment.</string>
		<string>If the water of your faith is clear, the moon of blessings will surely cast its reflection on it and protect you.</string>
		<string>An ordinary person is a Buddha, an ordinary person. This is what is meant by three thousand realms in a single moment of life and by the phase &quot;I in fact attained Buddhahood.&quot;</string>
		<string>Just as all the different kinds of plants and trees come forth from earth, so all the various teachings of the Buddha are spread by persons.</string>
		<string>If I do not call forth these enemies of the Lotus Sutra, then I will not be the votary of the Lotus Sutra. Only by making them appear can I be the votary.</string>
		<string>Today there people who have faith in the Lotus Sutra. The belief of some is like fire while that of others is like water. When the former listen to the teachings, their passion flares up like fire, but as time goes on, they tend to discard their faith. To have faith like water means to believe continuously without ever regressing.</string>
		<string>Gold can be neither by fire nor corroded or swept by water, but iron is vulnerable to both. A worth person is like gold, a fool like iron. You are like pure gold because you embrace the &apos;gold&apos; of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>The greatest evil among evil produces consequences that not only affect the perpetrators personally but extend to their sons, their grandsons, and so on down to the seventh generation. And the same is true of the greatest good among good.</string>
		<string>Amber draws dust, and a magnet attracts iron particles; here our evil karma is like the dust or iron, and the daimoku of the Lotus Sutra is like the amber or the magnet. If we consider these [analogies, we can see why] we should always chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.</string>
		<string>Unaware that time passes as quickly as a white colt glimpsed through a crack in the wall, ignorant as sheep being led to the slaughter, help hopeless prisoners by our concern for food and clothing, we fall heedlessly into the snares of fame and profit and in the end make our way back to that familiar village in the three evil paths, where we are reborn time after time in the realm of the six paths. What person of feeling could fail to grieve at such a state of affairs, or could fail to be moved to sorrow!</string>
		<string>No matter how troubled the time may become, the Lotus Sutra and ten demon daughters will protect all of you, praying as earnestly as though to produce fire from damp wood, or to obtain water from parched ground.</string>
		<string>When one who is able to show clearly visible proof in the present expounds the Lotus Sutra, there also will be persons who will believe.</string>
		<string>[The devil king] knows that those who hear even a single sentence or phrase of the Lotus Sutra will attain Buddhahood without fail and exceedingly distressed by this, contrives various plots and restrains and persecutes believe in an attempt to make them abandon their faith.</string>
		<string>All other troubles are no more to me than dust before the wind. I will be the pillar of Japan. I will be the eyes of Japan. I will be the great ship of Japan. This is my vow, and I will never forsake it!</string>
		<string>Human beings are vulnerable. They give their lives for shallow, worldly matters but rarely for the Buddha&apos;s precious teachings. Small wonder they do not attain Buddhahood.</string>
		<string>Even if their virtue is known throughout the country and their wisdom is as bright as the sun and moon, one should recognize that teachers who slander the Lotus Sutra are evil teachers and erroneous teachers, and refrain from approaching them.</string>
		<string>Those who fall into the evil paths because of their mistaken practice of Buddhism outnumber the dust particles of the land, while those who attain the Buddha way by practising the correct teaching are fewer than the specks of dirt that can be placed on a fingernail.</string>
		<string>It is extremely difficult to meet a person who expounds this sutra exactly as the sutra directs. It is even more difficult than for a one-eyed turtle to find a piece of floating sandalwood, or for someone to hang Mt Sumeru from the sky with the fibre from a lotus stem.</string>
		<string>This life is like a dream. One cannot be sure that one will live until tomorrow. However wretched a beggar you might become, never disagree the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>Mandala is a Sanskrit word that is translated as &apos;perfectly endowed&apos; or &apos;a cluster of blessing.&apos; This Gohonzon also is found only in the two characters for faith. This is what the sutra means when it state that one can &apos;gain entrance through faith alone.&apos;</string>
		<string>The journey from Kamukura to takes twelve days. If you travel for eleven but stop with only one day remaining, how can you admire the moon over the capital?</string>
		<string>Single-mindedly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and urge others to do the same; that will remain as the only memory of your present life in this human world.</string>
		<string>Regard your survival as wondrous. Employ the strategy of the Lotus Sutra before any other.</string>
		<string>Myoho-renge-kyo is the Buddha nature of all living beings. The Buddha nature is the Dharma nature, and the Dharma nature is enlightenment.</string>
		<string>A blue fly, if it clings to the tail of a thoroughbred horse, can travel ten thousand miles, and the green ivy that twines around the tall pine can grow to a thousand feet.</string>
		<string>Arouse deep faith, and diligently polish your mirror day and night. How should you polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.</string>
		<string>This I will state. Let the gods forsake me. Let all persecutions assail me. Still I will give my life for the sake of the Law.</string>
		<string>Be resolved to summon forth the great power of faith, and chant Nam-myoho-renge with the prayer that your faith will be steadfast and correct at the moment of death.</string>
		<string>I entrust you with the propagation of Buddhism in your province.</string>
		<string>Before the preaching of the Lotus Sutra, the people in the nine worlds were like plants and trees in autumn and winter. But when the single character (myo) of the Lotus Sutra shine on them like the spring and summer sun, then the flower of the aspiration for enlightenment blossomed, and the fruit of Buddhahood or rebirth in the pure land emerged.</string>
		<string>Only the ship of Myoho-renge-kyo enables one to cross the sea of the suffering of birth and death.</string>
		<string>The good fortune one receive from simply chanting the daimoku is beyond measure.</string>
		<string>Since repentance will eradicate even fixed karma, to say nothing of karma that is unfixed.</string>
		<string>The more gold is heated in the flames, the brighter will be its colour; the more a sword is whetted, the sharper it will become. And the more one praises the blessings of the Lotus Sutra, the more one&apos;s own blessings will increase.</string>
		<string>&quot;Now, in widely propagating the Buddhist teachings and bringing salvation to all people, one must first take into consideration the teaching, the capacity of the people, the time, the country, and the sequence of propagation.&quot;</string>
		<string>Thus, encountering this sutra is as the blossoming of the udumbara flower, which occurs but once in three thousand years, or the one-eyed turtle finding a floating piece of sandalwood, whip happens only once in innumerable, boundless kalpas. Suppose one were to place a needle in the earth point up and throw down tiny mustard seeds at it from the palace of the great King Brahma in the heavens. One could sooner impale a mustard seed on the point of a needle in this way than encounter the daimoku of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>Since the remotest past up until now, you have merely suffered in vain the pains of countless existences. Why do you not, if only this once, try planting the wonderful seeds that lead to eternal and unchanging Buddhahood? Though at present you may taste only a tiny fraction of the everlasting joys that await you in the future, surely you should not spend your time thoughtlessly coveting worldly fame and profit, which are as fleeting as a bolt of lightning or the morning dew.</string>
		<string>When the skies are clear, the ground is illuminated. Similarly, when one knows the Lotus Sutra, one understands the meaning of all worldly affairs.</string>
		<string>Great evil portends the arrival of great good. If all of Jambudvipa were to be thrown into chaos, there could &quot;be no doubt that [this sutra would]&quot; be widely propagated throughout Jambudvipa.&quot;</string>
		<string>For example, the flaws in iron come to the surface when it is forged. Put into flames, a rock simply turns to ashes, but gold become pure gold. This trial, more than anything else, will prove your faith genuine.</string>
		<string>Hell is in the heart of a person who inwardly despises his father and disregard his mother.</string>
		<string>No treasure tower exits other than Myoho-renge-kyo. The daimoku of the Lotus Sutra is the treasure tower, and the treasure tower is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.</string>
		<string>Only by defeating a powerful enemy can one person one&apos;s real strength.</string>
		<string>What is called faith is nothing unusual. Faith means putting one&apos;s trust in the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni, Many Treasures, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions, and the heavenly gods and benevolent deities, and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo as a woman cherishes her husband, as a man lays down his life for his wife, as parents refuse to abandon their children, or as a child refuses to leave its mother.</string>
		<string>Moreover, even though one may encounter a wise teacher and the true sutra and thereby embrace the correct teaching, when one resolve to break free from the sufferings of birth and death and attain Buddhahood, one will inevitably encounter seven grave matters known as the three obstacles and four devils, just as surely as a shadow follows the body and clouds accompany rain. Even if you should manage to overcome the first six, if you are defeated by the seventh, you will not be able to become a Buddha.</string>
		<string>Teach others to the best of your ability, even if it is only a single sentence or phrase.</string>
		<string>The moon appears in the west and sheds its light eastward, but the sun rises in the east and casts its rays to the west. The same is true of Buddhism. It spread from west to east in the Former and Middle Days of the Law, but will travel from east to west in the Latter Day.</string>
		<string>Now there is no need to attempt to surmise yourself how things will go. Whether or not your prayers is answered will depend on your faith; [if it is not] I will in no way be to blame.</string>
		<string>There is definitely something extraordinary in the ebb and flow of the tide, the rising and setting of the moon, and the way in which summer, autumn, winter, and spring give way to each other. Something uncommon also occurs when an ordinary person attains Buddhahood. At such a time, the three obstacles and four devils will invariably appear, and the wise will rejoice while the foolish will retreat.</string>
		<string>Money serves various purposes according to our needs. The same is true of the Lotus Sutra. It is a lantern in the dark or a boat at a crossing. At times it is water and, at times, fire. This being so, the Lotus Sutra assures us of &quot;peace and security in our present existence and good circumstances in future existences.&quot;</string>
		<string>When a caged bird sings, birds who are flying in the sky are thereby summoned and gather around, and when the birds flying in the sky gather around, the bird in the cage strives to get out. When with our mouths we chant the Mystic Law, our Buddha nature, being summoned, will invariably emerge.</string>
		<string>One who has fallen to the ground recovers and rises up from the ground. Those who slander the Lotus Sutra will fall to the ground of the three evil paths, or of the human and heavenly realms, but in the end, through the help of the Lotus Sutra, they will attain Buddhahood.</string>
		<string>Dewdrops accumulate to form a stream, and streams accumulate to form the great ocean. Particles of dust accumulate to form a mountain, and mountains accumulate to form Mt Sumeru. And in the same way, trifling matters accumulate to become grave ones.</string>
		<string>The gold that a fool possesses is no different from the gold that a wise man possesses; a fire made by a fool is the same as a fire made by a wise man. However, there is a different if one chants the Daimoku while acting against the intent of this sutra.</string>
		<string>Those who endeavour to practice the Buddhist Law and who care about what happens to them in future lives should know what a fearful thing it is to slander the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>Hence, if the Law one embraces is supreme, then the person who embraces it must accordingly be foremost among all others.</string>
		<string>Even embracing the Lotus Sutra would be useless without the heritage of faith.</string>
		<string>At first only Nichiren chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, but then two, three, and a hundred followed, chanting and teaching others. Propagation will unfold this way in the future as well. Does this not signify &apos;emerging from the earth?&apos;</string>
		<string>Living beings like ourselves have dwelt in the sea of the sufferings of birth and death since time without beginning. But they become votaries of the Lotus Sutra, and realise that their bodies and minds, which have existed since the beginningless past, are inherently endowed with the eternally unchanging nature; awaken to their mystic reality with their mystic wisdom; and attain the Buddha&apos;s body, which is as indestructible as a diamond. How then could they be different from that Buddha?</string>
		<string>There is no true happiness for human beings other than chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The sutra reads, &quot;… where living beings enjoy themselves at ease.&quot; How could this passage mean anything but the boundless joy of the Law?</string>
		<string>It makes no difference if the practitioner himself is lacking in worth, defective in wisdom, impure in his person, and lacking in virtue derived from observing the precepts. So long as he chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, they will invariably protect him.</string>
		<string>Out of the Buddha&apos;s many teachings you have encountered the daimoku, or the title, of the Lotus Sutra and become its votary. Truly you are a person who has offered alms to a hundred thousand million Buddhas in his past existences!</string>
		<string>Our contemporaries think of the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo only as a name, but this is not correct. It is the essence, that is, the heart of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>&quot;Knowledge without faith&quot; describes those who are knowledgeable about the Buddhist doctrines but have no faith. These people will never attain Buddhahood. Those of &quot;faith without knowledge&quot; may lack knowledge but have faith and can attain Buddhahood.</string>
		<string>When the water is clear, the moon is reflected. When the wind blows, the trees shake. Our minds are like the water. Faith that is weak is like muddy water, while faith that is brave is like clear water.</string>
		<string>For example, flint has the potential to produce fire, and gems have intrinsic value. We ordinary people can see neither our own eyelashes, which are so close, nor the heavens in the distance. Likewise, we do not see that the Buddha exists in our own hearts.</string>
		<string>This is similar to a tarnished mirror that will shine like a jewel when polished. A mind now clouded by the illusions of the innate darkness of like is like a tarnished mirror, but when polished, it is sure to become like a clear mirror, reflecting the essential nature of phenomena and the true aspect of reality.</string>
		<string>When the world makes you feel downcast, you should chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, remembering that, although the sufferings of this life are painful, those in the next like could be much worse.</string>
		<string>There are also many who are beaten in punishment for attempting to seduce other men&apos;s wives or for theft or other offences. Yet, not one person has ever suffered injury on account of the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, the upholders of the sutra in Japan are not yet worthy of these sutra passages. I alone have read the sutra with my entire being. This is the meaning of the passage that says, &quot;We care nothing for our bodies or lives but are anxious only for the unsurpassed way.&quot; I am therefore the foremost votary of the Lotus Sutra in Japan.</string>
		<string>And yet we have obtained birth in the human world, something difficult to achieve, and have encountered the sacred teachings of the Thus Come One, which are rarely to be met. We are like the one-eyed turtle finding a floating log with a hole in it that fits him exactly. How regrettable it would be, then, if we did not take this opportunity to sever the bonds of birth and death, making no attempt to free ourselves from the cage of the threefold world!</string>
		<string>Rather than offering up ten thousand prayers for remedy, it would be better simply to outlaw this one evil.</string>
		<string>None of you who declare yourselves to be my disciples should ever give way to cowardice, Neither should you allow concern for your parents, wife, or children to hold you back, or be worried about your property.</string>
		<string>When the world is at peace, worthies are hard to distinguish. It is when the age is in turmoil that both sages and fools come into view.</string>
		<string>The boy Virtue Victorious, who offered a mud pie to the Buddha, was later reborn as King Ashoka, who ruled over most of the southern continent of Jambudvipa. Since the Buddha is worthy of respect, the boy was able to receive this great reward even though the pie was only mud.</string>
		<string>Worthy persons deserve to be called so because they are not carried away by the eight winds: prosperity, decline, disgrace, honour, praise, censure, suffering, and pleasure. They are neither elated by prosperity nor grieved by decline. The heavenly gods will surely protect one who is unbending before the eight winds.</string>
		<string>Any weakness in faith will be a cause for regret. The cart that overturns on the road ahead is a warning to the one behind. In an age like this no one can help but thirst for the way. You may hate this world, but you cannot escape it.</string>
		<string>Believe in this mandala with all your heart. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is like the roar of a lion. What sickness can therefore be an obstacle?</string>
		<string>One who recites even one word or phrase of the Lotus Sutra and who speaks about it to another person is the emissary of Shakyamuni Buddha, lord of the teachings.</string>
		<string>When he was alive, he was a Buddha in life, and now he is a Buddha in death. He is a Buddha in both life and death. This is what is meant by that most important doctrine called attaining Buddhahood in one&apos;s present form.</string>
		<string>Everyone in Japan, from the sovereign on down to the common people, without exception has tried to do me harm, but I have survived until this day. You should realise that this is because, although I am alone, I have firm faith.</string>
		<string>Those concerned about their next life would do better to be common people in this, the Latter Day of the Law, of the Former and Middle Days of the Law. Why won&apos;t people believe this? Rather than be the chief priest of the Tendai school, it is better to be a leper who chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo!</string>
		<string>&quot;How fortunate that I can give my life for the Lotus Sutra! If I am to lose this worthless head [for Buddhahood], it will be like trading sand for gold or rocks for jewels.&quot;</string>
		<string>Be that as it may, commit yourself to the Lotus Sutra and have faith in its teachings. You must not only believe in them yourself, but also encourage others to do the same, so that you may save those who were your parents in all your past existences.</string>
		<string>Untempered iron quickly melts in a blazing fire, like ice put in hot water. But a sword, even when exposed to a great fire, withstands the heat for a while, because it has been well forged.</string>
		<string>When we revere Myoho-renge-kyo inherent in our own life as the object of devotion, the Buddha nature within us is summoned forth and manifested by our chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. This is what is meant by &quot;Buddha.&quot;</string>
		<string>This spiritual bond … Herein lies the true goal of Nichiren&apos;s propagation. When you are so united, even the great desire for widespread propagation can be fulfilled.</string>
		<string>Concerning the debt owed to the Law, the Law is the teacher of all Buddhas. It is because of the Law that the Buddhas are worthy of respect. Therefore, those who wish to repay their debt to the Buddha must first repay the debt they owe to the Law.</string>
		<string>The sutra states, &quot;Those persons who had heard the Law dwelled here and there in various Buddha lands, constantly reborn in company with their teachers.&quot;</string>
		<string>In this world, we owe four debts of gratitude. One who understands this is worthy to be called human, while one who does not is no more than an animal.</string>
		<string>You must build your reputation on the Lotus Sutra and give yourself up to it.</string>
		<string>Himoku are the fish with only one eye each, so the male and female remain together for life. A husband and wife should be like them.</string>
		<string>The heavenly gods will surely protect … But if you nurse an unreasonable grudge against your lord, they will not protect you, not for all your prayers.</string>
		<string>I pray that you will embrace the Mystic Law, which guarantees that people &quot;will enjoy peace and security in their present existence and good circumstances in future existences.&quot; This is the only glory that you need seek in your present lifetime, and is the action that will draw you towards Buddhahood in your next existence.</string>
		<string>When you chant the daimoku of this sutra, you should be aware that it is a more joyful thing than for one who was born blind to gain sight and see ones father and mother, and a rarer thing than for a man who has been seized by a powerful enemy to be released and reunited with his wife and children.</string>
		<string>The practice we should perform in order to master the correct teaching and attain Buddhahood depends upon the time.</string>
		<string>My disciples, form your ranks and follow me, and surpass even Mahakasyapa or Ananda, T&apos;ien-t&apos;ai or Dengyo!</string>
		<string>If you propagate it, devils will arise without fail. If they did not, there would be no way of knowing that this is the correct teaching.</string>
		<string>According to the Buddhist teaching, however, even those who commit the five cardinal sins may be saved, and even those who are unfilial may gain salvation. It is only the icchantikas, or persons of incorrigible disbelief, those who slander the Law, and those who pretend to be foremost in observing the precepts who cannot be forgiven.</string>
		<string>One does not throw away gold because the bag that holds it is dirty; one does not ignore the sandalwood trees because of the foul odour of the eranda trees around them; and one does not refuse to gather lotuses because the pond in the valley where they grow is not clean. If they ignore the practitioner of the Lotus Sutra, they will be going against their vow.</string>
		<string>When you are happy, you should remember that your happiness in this life is nothing but a dream within a dream, and that the only true happiness is that found in the pure land of Eagle Peak, and with that thought in mind, chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.</string>
		<string>If we hope to bring order and tranquility to the world without further delay, we must put an end to these slanders of the Law that fill the country.</string>
		<string>Matters of minor importance arise from good, but when it comes to a matter of great importance, great disaster without fail changes into great fortune.</string>
		<string>The Venerable Maudgalyayana put his faith in the Lotus Sutra, which is the greatest good there is, and thus not only did he himself attain Buddhahood but his father and mother did so as well.</string>
		<string>A woman who embraces this sutra not only excels all other women, but also surpasses all men.</string>
		<string>The observation of the mind means to observe one&apos;s own mind and to find the Ten Worlds within it. This is what is called observing the mind.</string>
		<string>The old fox never forgets the hillock where he was born; the white turtle repaid the kindness he had received from Mao Pao. If even lowly creatures know enough to do this, then how much more should human beings!</string>
		<string>When it comes to studying the teachings of Buddhism, one must first learn to understand the time.</string>
		<string>Never seek this Gohonzon outside yourself. The Gohonzon exists only within the mortal flesh of us ordinary people who embrace the Lotus Sutra and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The body is the palace of the ninth consciousness, the unchanging reality that reigns over all of life&apos;s functions.</string>
		<string>Urge on, but not frighten, the ones from Atsuhara who are ignorant of Buddhism. Tell them to be prepared for the worst, and not to expect good times, but take the bad times for granted.</string>
		<string>When one comes to the end of one&apos;s good fortune, no strategy whatsoever avails. When one&apos;s karmic rewards are exhausted, even one&apos;s retainers no longer follow one.</string>
		<string>In the end , no one can escape death. The sufferings at that time will be exactly like what we are experiencing now. Since death is the same in either case, you should be willing to offer your life for the Lotus Sutra. Think of this offering as a drop of dew rejoining the ocean, or a speck of dust returning to the earth.</string>
		<string>Because Buddhism has gradually been turned upside down, the secular world also has been plunged into corruption and chaos. Buddhism is like the body, and society like the shadow. When the body bends, so does the shadow.</string>
		<string>Ice is made of water, but it is colder than water. Blue dye comes from indigo, but when something is repeatedly dyed in it, the colour is better than that of the indigo plant. The Lotus Sutra remains the same, but if you repeatedly strengthen your resolve, your colour will be better than that of others, and you will receive more blessings than they do.</string>
		<string>A man is like a pillar, a woman like the crossbeam. A man is like the legs of a person, a woman like the trunk. A man is like the wings of a bird, a woman like the body. If the wings and the body become separated, then how can the bird fly? And if the pillar topples, then the crossbeam will surely fall to the ground.</string>
		<string>A person of wisdom is not one who practises Buddhism apart from worldly affairs but, rather, one who thoroughly understands the principles by which the world is governed.</string>
		<string>Neither non-Buddhists nor the enemies of Buddhism can destroy the correct teaching of the Thus Come One, but the Buddha&apos;s disciples definitely can. As a sutra says, only worms born of the lion&apos;s body feed on the lion. A person of great fortune will never be ruined by enemies, but may be ruined by those who are close.</string>
		<string>How much more effective, then, is the daimoku of the Lotus sutra, which is the very heart of all the eighty thousand sacred teachings of Buddhism and the eye of all the Buddhas! How can you doubt that by chanting it you can escape from the four evil paths?</string>
		<string>Take these teachings to heart, and always remember that believers in the Lotus Sutra should absolutely be that last to abuse one another. All those who keep faith in the Lotus Sutra are most certainly Buddhas, and one who slanders a Buddha commits a grave offence.</string>
		<string>One who abides by the Lotus Sutra will inevitably attain Buddhahood. Therefore, the devil king of the sixth heaven, the lord of this threefold world, will become intensely jealous of anyone who abides by the sutra.</string>
		<string>Myoho-renge-kyo is neither the scriptural text nor its meaning, but the heart of the entire sutra.</string>
		<string>The Buddha&apos;s preaching of the Law is called the lion&apos;s roar, and the Lotus Sutra is the foremost roar of the lion.</string>
		<string>To become the master of your mind rather than let your mind master you.</string>
		<string>Neither the pure land nor hell exists outside oneself; both lie only within one&apos;s own heart. Awakened to this, one is called a Buddha; deluded about it, one is called an ordinary person.</string>
		<string>Though one might point at the earth and miss it, though one might bind up the sky, though the tides might cease to ebb and flow and the sun rise in the west, it could never come about that the prayers of the practitioner of the Lotus Sutra would go unanswered.</string>
		<string>There should be no discrimination among those who propagate the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo in the Latter Day of the Law, be they men or women. Were they not Bodhisattvas of the Earth, they could not chant the daimoku.</string>
		<string>Speak in a mild manner, no matter what the circumstances. If people should try to weaken your belief in the Lotus Sutra, consider that your faith is being tested.</string>
		<string>When a tree has been transplanted, though fierce winds may blow, it will not topple if it has a firm stake to hold it up. But even a tree that has grown up in place may fall over if its roots are weak. Even a feeble person will not stumble if those supporting him are strong, but a person of considerable strength, when alone, may fall down on an uneven path.</string>
		<string>The Great Teacher Miao-lo stated, &quot;The stronger one&apos;s faith, the greater the protection of the gods,&quot; So long as one maintains firm faith, one is certain to receive the great protection of the gods.</string>
		<string>The cuckoo sings when spring is waning, the cock waits until the break of day to crow. If even these lowly creatures have such an understanding of time, then how can a person who wished to practise the teachings of Buddhism fail to make certain what time it is?</string>
		<string>If you earnestly pray that blessings be given to you without delay, how can your prayers fail to be answered?</string>
		<string>Life flashes by in but a moment. No matter how many terrible enemies you may encounter, banish all fears and never think of backsliding.</string>
		<string>It is expounded that even the treasures of the entire major world system cannot equal the value of one&apos;s body and life. Even the treasures that fill the major world system are no substitute for life.</string>
		<string>Being known as a votary of the Lotus Sutra is a bitter, yet unavoidable, destiny.</string>
		<string>So long as persons of wisdom do not prove my teachings to be false, I will never yield!</string>
		<string>We ordinary beings are fettered by evil karma, earthly desires, and the sufferings of birth and death. But due to the three inherent potentials of the Buddha nature — innate Buddhahood, the wisdom to perceive it, and the actions to manifest it — we can without doubt reveal the Buddha&apos;s three bodies — the Dharma Body, the reward body, and the manifested body.</string>
		<string>In the past, and in the present Latter Day of the Law, the rulers, high ministers, and people who despise the votaries of the Lotus Sutra seem to be free from punishment at first, but eventually they are all doomed to fall.</string>
		<string>&quot;How sad is this lot of ours, that all who are born must perish! Though one may live to a great age, in the end one cannot escape this impermanence …&quot;</string>
		<string>The Lotus Sutra is a lamp, and its votary is the oil that sustains it. Or again, the lay supporters are the oil that sustains the lamp of the votary.</string>
		<string>Even an individual at cross purposes with himself is certain to end in failure, Yet a hundred or even a thousand people can definitely attain their goal, if they are of one mind.</string>
		<string>Is not the meaning of the sutra and the commentary that the way to Buddhahood lies within the two elements of reality and wisdom? Reality means the true nature of all phenomena, and wisdom means the illuminating and manifesting of this true nature. Thus when the riverbed of reality is infinitely broad and deep, the water of wisdom will flow ceaselessly.</string>
		<string>In China and Japan in the past, sages of outstanding wisdom and ability have from time to time appeared. But none, as an ally of the Lotus Sutra, has faced such powerful enemies within his country as have I, Nichiren. From the facts present before your very eyes, it should be apparent that Nichiren is the foremost person in the entire land of Jambudvipa.</string>
		<string>The Buddha fulfilled the purpose of his advent in a little over forty years, the Great Teacher T&apos;ien-t&apos;ai took about thirty years, and the Great Teacher Dengyo, some twenty years. I have spoken repeatedly of the indescribable persecutions they suffered during those years. For me it took twenty-seven years, and the great persecutions I faced during this period are well known to you all.</string>
		<string>Such persons, who honestly discard expedient means, put faith in the Lotus Sutra alone, and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, will transform the three paths of earthly desires, karma, and suffering into the three virtues of the Dharma body, wisdom, and emancipation. The threefold contemplation and the three truths will immediately become manifest in their minds, and the place where they live will become the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light.</string>
		<string>Through the power of the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Law they can do so in their present form. This means that both the teacher who expounds the principles of the Lotus Sutra and the disciple who receives his teachings will, in no long time, together become Buddhas through the power of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>And because our wisdom is inadequate, he teaches us to substitute faith for wisdom, making this single word &quot;faith&quot; the foundation.</string>
		<string>Nam-myoho-renge-key is the heart of the Lotus Sutra. It is like the soul of a person.</string>
		<string>How wondrous it is that, around two hundred years and more into the Latter Day of the Law, I was the first to reveal as the banner of propagation of the Lotus Sutra this great mandala that even those such as Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu, T&apos;ien-t&apos;ai and Miao-lo were unable to express.</string>
		<string>The strong and steadfast power of faith is precious indeed.</string>
		<string>Whether one has wealth or not, no treasure exceeds the one called life.</string>
		<string>One who, on hearing the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, makes even greater efforts in faith is a true seeker of the way.</string>
		<string>If a teacher has a good disciple, both will gain the fruit of Buddhahood, but if a teacher fosters a bad disciple, both will fall into hell. If teacher and disciple are of different minds, they will never accomplish anything.</string>
		<string>Those among my followers who fail to carry through their faith to the end will incur punishment even more severe. Even so, they should not harbour a grudge against me.</string>
		<string>On the path of attaining Buddhahood, chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo without arrogance or attachment to biased views.</string>
		<string>Death comes to all, even should nothing untoward ever happen. Therefore, you must never be cowardly, or you will become the object of ridicule.</string>
		<string>Believe in the Gohonzon, the supreme object of devotion in all of Jambudvipa. Be sure to strengthen your faith, and receive the protection of Shakyamuni, Many Treasures, and the Buddhas of the ten directions.</string>
		<string>One who climbs a high mountain must eventually descend. One who slights another will in turn be despised.</string>
		<string>Even among those who embrace the Lotus Sutra according to its words, there are some who resent the votary of the Lotus sutra either because of their greed, anger, and foolishness, because of worldly matters, or because of his various actions. Although such people believe in the Lotus Sutra, they will not obtain the benefit of faith, but will instead incur retribution.</string>
		<string>There are many people who set their hearts on enlightenment, but only a few who continue their practice and in fact attain the true way. The aspiration for enlightenment in common mortals is often hindered by evil influences and easily swayed by circumstances.</string>
		<string>One should understand that, at present, when it comes to teachers, there is a difference between correct teachers and erroneous teachers, between good teachers and bad teachers. One should shun those who are erroneous or evil, and associate with those who are correct and good.</string>
		<string>[The Annotations on the Nirvana Sutra states,] &quot;One&apos;s body is insignificant while the Law is supreme. One should give one&apos;s life in order to propagate the Law.&quot; Because my body in insignificant, I am struck and hated, but because the Law is supreme, it will spread without fail.</string>
		<string>The mystic principle that is the essential nature of phenomena possesses two aspects, the defiled aspect and the pure aspect. If the defiled aspect is operative, this is called delusion. If the pure aspect is operative, this is called enlightenment. Enlightenment constitutes the realm of Buddhahood. Delusion constitutes the realms of ordinary mortals.</string>
		<string>True priests are those who are honest and who desire little and yet know satisfaction.</string>
		<string>Now more than two hundred years have passed since we entered the Latter Day of the Law, a time of which, as the Great Collection Sutra records, the Buddha predicted that &quot;quarrels and disputes will arise among the adherents to my teachings, and the pure Law will become obscured and lost.&quot; If these words of the Buddha are true, it is a time when the whole land of Jambudvipa will without doubt be embroiled in quarrels and disputes.</string>
		<string>How much sadder, then, is the lot of the human beings living on this land of Jambudvipa, whose life is more fleeting than the dew, more fragile than the plantain leaf, more insubstantial than bubbles or foam! Like the moon reflected in the water, one is not even certain whether one exists or not; like the dew on the grass, one may vanish at any moment. &quot;Anyone who grasps this principle should know that it is of utmost importance to take thought for the existence to come.</string>
		<string>The two millennia of the Former and Middle Days of the Law required the spread of the Hinayana and provisional Mahayana teachings, but the first five hundred years of the Latter Day call for only the Lotus Sutra, the pure and perfect teaching of the one vehicle of Buddhahood, to be spread abroad widely.</string>
		<string>Those who, because of slandering the Law, fall into the Avichi hell, will be more numerous than the dust particles of the land, while those who, by embracing the Law, are freed from the sufferings of birth and death, will number less than the specks of dirt that can be placed on a fingernail.</string>
		<string>Those who make offerings to the Lotus Sutra will receive the same benefit as they would by making offerings to all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas in the ten directions, because all the Buddhas of the ten directions originate from the single character myo.</string>
		<string>The hearts of the people are like those of birds and beasts; they recognise neither sovereign, teacher, nor parent. Even less do they distinguish between correct and incorrect in Buddhism, or good and evil in their teachers.</string>
		<string>If one&apos;s heavy karma from the past is not expiated within this lifetime, one must undergo the sufferings of hell in the future, but if one experiences extreme hardship in this life [because of the Lotus Sutra], the sufferings of hell will vanish instantly.</string>
		<string>Though lacking in knowledge of Buddhism, a person of faith, even if dull-witted, is to be reckoned as a person of correct views. But even though one has some knowledge of Buddhism, if one is without faith, then one is to be considered a slanderer and an icchantika, or person of incorrigible disbelief.</string>
		<string>This woman chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo at the moment of her death. This is as rare as the one-eyed turtle finding a suitable hollow in a floating sandalwood log, or a thread lowered from the heavens passing through the eye of a needle on earth. How wondrous!</string>
		<string>Your practice of the Buddhist teachings will not relieve you of the sufferings of birth and death in the least unless you perceive the true nature of your life. If you seek enlightenment outside yourself, then your performing even ten thousand practices and ten thousand good deeds will be in vain. It is like the case of a poor man who spends night and day counting his neighbour&apos;s wealth but gains not even half a coin.</string>
		<string>To hope to attain Buddhahood without speaking out against slander is as futile as trying to find water in the midst of fire or fire in the midst of water.</string>
		<string>The &quot;Teacher of the Law&quot; chapter reads, &quot;Since hatred and jealousy towards this sutra abound even when the Thus Come One is in the world, how much more will this be so after his passing?&quot;</string>
		<string>You should realise that it is because of a profound karmic relationship from the past that you can teach other even a sentence or phrase of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>Buddhism should be spread by the method of either shoju or shakubuku, depending on the age. These are analogous to the two worldly ways of the literary and the military.</string>
		<string>But those who disbelieve and slander the Lotus Sutra will immediately &quot;destroy all the seeds for becoming a Buddha in this world.&quot; Because they cut themselves off from the potential to attain enlightenment, they do not share the heritage of the ultimate Law of life and death.</string>
		<string>Exert yourself in the two ways of practice and study. Without practice and study, there can be no Buddhas. You must not only persevere yourself; you must also teach others. Both practice and study arise from faith.</string>
		<string>When the people all chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the wind will no longer buffer the branches, and the rain will no longer break the clods of soil.</string>
		<string>Even people who live a long time rarely live beyond the age of one hundred. And all the events of a lifetime are like the dream one dreams in a brief nap.</string>
		<string>An arrogant person will always be overcome with fear when meeting a strong enemy, as was the haughty asura who shrank in size and hid himself in a lotus blossom in Heat-Free Lake when reproached by Shakra.</string>
		<string>Therefore, the Great Teacher Miao-lo remarks: &quot;Whether or not the teachings are grasped correctly depends upon the persons who transmit them. It is not determined by the sage&apos;s original pronouncements.&quot; He is saying that no matter how the people of today may follow the teachings of the sutras in hopes of a better life in the hereafter, if the sutras they follow are in error, then they can never attain enlightenment.</string>
		<string>All disciples and lay supporters of Nichiren should chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with the spirit of many in body but one in mind, transcending all differences among themselves to become as inseparable as fish and the water in which they swim. This spiritual bond is the basis for the universal transmission of the ultimate Law of life and death.</string>
		<string>The moon rises from behind the mountains to shed light on them. Misfortune comes from one&apos;s mouth and ruins one, but fortune comes from one&apos;s heart and makes one worthy of respect.</string>
		<string>Even a bad reputation will spread far and wide. A good reputation will spread even farther, particularly if it is a reputation for devotion to the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>Offering the food that is the only means for sustaining one&apos;s life that day to the Buddha is offering one&apos;s life to the Buddha.</string>
		<string>Since nothing is more precious than life itself, one who dedicates one&apos;s life to Buddhist practice is certain to attain Buddhahood. If one is prepared to offer one&apos;s life, why should one begrudge any other treasure for the sake of Buddhism? On the other hand, if one is loath to part with one&apos;s wealth, how can one possibly offer one&apos;s life, which is far more valuable?</string>
		<string>To see evil and fail to admonish it, to be aware of slander and not combat it, is to go against the words of the sutras and to disobey the Buddhist patriarchs. The punishment for this offence is extremely severe.</string>
		<string>Since Nichiren&apos;s disciples and lay supporters believe solely in the Lotus Sutra, honestly discarding expedient means and not accepting even a single verse of the other sutras, exactly as the Lotus teaches, they can enter the treasure tower of the Gohonzon. How reassuring!</string>
		<string>If a spark as small as a bean is set to a single blade of grass in a spring field of a thousand square ri thick with grass, it becomes in an instant an immeasurable, boundless blaze. Such is also the case with this robe. Though only one robe, it has been offered to the Buddhas of all the characters of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>When I, Nichiren, first took faith in the Lotus Sutra, I was like a single drop of water or a single particle of dust in all the country of Japan. But later, when two people, three people, ten people, and eventually a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, and a million people come to recite the Lotus Sutra and transmit it to others, then they will form a Mt Sumeru of perfect enlightenment, an ocean of great nirvana. Seek no other path by which to attain Buddhahood!</string>
		<string>Even those who lack understanding, so long as they chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, can avoid the evil paths. This is like lotus flowers, which turn as the sun does, though the lotus has no mind to direct it, or like the plantain that grows with the rumbling of thunder, though this plant has no ears to hear it. Now we are like the lotus or the plantain, and the daimoku of the Lotus Sutra is like the sun or the thunder.</string>
		<string>The mystic principle of the true aspect of reality is one, but if it encounters evil influences, it will manifest delusion, while if it encounters good influences, it will manifest enlightenment. Enlightenment means enlightenment to the essential nature of phenomena, and delusion, ignorance of it.</string>
		<string>In battles soldiers regard the general as their soul. If the general were to lose heart, his soldiers would become cowards.</string>
		<string>Those who persecute a votary of the Lotus Sutra in the defiled age will have their heads split into seven pieces.</string>
		<string>The five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo do not represent the sutra text, nor are they its meaning. They are nothing other than the intent of the entire sutra. So, even though the beginners in Buddhist practice may not understand their significance, they will naturally conform to the sutra&apos;s intent.</string>
		<string>There are four kinds of punishment: general and individual, conspicuous and inconspicuous. The epidemics and famines that have attacked Japan, as well as the strife within the ruling clan and the foreign invasion, are general punishment. Epidemics are a form of inconspicuous punishment. The deaths of Ota and the others are both conspicuous and individual.</string>
		<string>Now, if the people resort to prayers without understanding the basic cause of these disasters, can there be any doubt that the nation will in time face ruin?</string>
		<string>Furthermore, the Lotus Sutra teaches that the votary of this sutra will receive the protection of the bodhisattvas who emerged from the earth as the bodhisattvas Manjushri and Perceiver of the World&apos;s Sounds, Brahma, Shakra, the gods of the sun and moon, the four heavenly kings, and the ten demon daughters.</string>
		<string>&quot;You have been imbued with the fragrance of your orchid-room friends; you have become upright like mugwort growing in a field of hemp …&quot;</string>
		<string>No matter how furiously a fire may rage, it burns out after a while. On the other hand, water may appear to move slowly, but its flow does not easily vanish. Since you are hot-tempered and behave like a blazing fire, you will certainly be deceived by others.</string>
		<string>My followers are now able to accept and uphold the Lotus Sutra because of the strong ties they formed with it in their past existences. They are certain to obtain the fruit of Buddhahood in the future, The heritage of the Lotus Sutra flows within the lives of those who never forsake it in any lifetime whatsoever — whether in the past, the present, or the future.</string>
		<string>Myo means to revive, that is, to return to life.</string>
		<string>It is the power of the bow that determines the flight of the arrow, the might of the dragon that controls the movement of the clouds, and the strength of the wife that guides the actions of her husband.</string>
		<string>All the characters in which the Lotus Sutra is written represent living Buddhas. But because we have the eyes of common mortals, we see them as characters. It is like the example of Ganges River. Hungry spirits see the waters of the river as fire, human beings see them as water, and heavenly beings see them as amrita. The waters are the same in all cases, but each type of being sees them differently, according to the effects of its karma.</string>
		<string>The supreme principle [that is the Mystic Law] was originally without a name. When the sage was observing the principle and assigning names to all things, he perceived that there is this wonderful single Law [myoho] that simultaneously possesses both cause and effect [renge], and he named it Myoho-renge-kyo. This single Law that is Myoho-renge-kyo encompasses within it all the phenomena comprising the Ten Worlds and the three thousand realms, and is lacking in none of them. Anyone who practises this Law will obtain both the cause and the effect of Buddhahood simultaneously.</string>
		<string>Anyone who speaks a word of slander against me will be committing a crime that will condemn him to the hell of incessant suffering, and anyone who offers so much as a word or a phrase on my behalf will acquire greater blessings than if he had made offerings to countless Buddhas.</string>
		<string>This mandala is in no way my invention. It is the object of devotion that depicts Shakyamuni Buddha, the World-Honoured One, seated in the treasure tower of Many Treasures Buddha, and the Buddhas who were Shakyamuni&apos;s emanations as perfectly as a print matches its woodblock.</string>
		<string>Since countless kalpas in the past you have thrown away your life more times than the number of dust particles of the land for the sake of your parents, your children, or your lands, But not once have you given up your life for the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>You may think you offered gifts to the treasure tower of the Thus Come One Many Treasures, but that is not so. You offered them to yourself.</string>
		<string>However, as for the matter of becoming a Buddha, ordinary people keep in mind the words &quot;earnest resolve&quot; and thereby become Buddhas.</string>
		<string>There have been instances in which those who governed a thousand or ten thousand cho of land had their lives summarily taken and their estates confiscated over trifling matters. If you give your life now for the sake of the Lotus Sutra, what is there to regret?</string>
		<string>If you truly fear the sufferings of birth and death and yearn for nirvana, if you carry out your faith and thirst for the way, then the sufferings of change and impermanence will become no more than yesterday&apos;s dream, and the awakening of enlightenment will become today&apos;s reality. If only you chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, then what offence could fail to be eradicated? What blessing could fail to come?</string>
		<string>T&apos;ien-t&apos;ai states, &quot;From the indigo, and even deeper blue.&quot; This passage means that, if one dyes something repeatedly in indigo, it becomes even bluer than the indigo leaves. The Lotus Sutra is like the indigo, and the strength of one&apos;s practice is like the deepening blue.</string>
		<string>If a boat is handled by an unskilled steersman, it may capsize and drown everyone aboard, Likewise, though someone may have great physical strength, if he lacks a resolute spirit, even his many abilities will be of no use.</string>
		<string>When the sun rises, the stars go into hiding. When a worthy king appears, foolish kings perish. When the true sutra is spread widely, the provisional sutras will cease to circulate, and when a man of wisdom chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, those ignorant of it will follow after him as shadows follow a form and echoes follow a sound.</string>
		<string>The Lotus Sutra is like the seed, the Buddha like the sower, and the people like the field. If you deviate from these principles, not even I can save you in your next life.</string>
		<string>Shakyamuni&apos;s practices and the virtues he consequently attained are all contained within the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo. If we believe in these five characters, we will naturally be granted the same benefits as he was.</string>
		<string>However great the good causes one may make, or even if one reads and copies the entirety of the Lotus Sutra a thousand or ten thousand times, or attains the way of perceiving three thousand realms in a single moment of life, if one fails to denounce the enemies of the Lotus Sutra, it will be impossible to attain the way.</string>
		<string>How, then, are you to go about nurturing faith in the Lotus Sutra? For if you try to practise the teachings of the sutra without faith, it would be like trying to enter a jewelled mountain without hands [to pick up its treasure], or like trying to make a thousand-mile journey without feet.</string>
		<string>Therefore, you should take every care to ward off slanderers of the Law in the same way that you would never wish a courtesan even to come near your home. This is the meaning of &quot;Thrust aside evil friends and associate with good companions.&quot;</string>
		<string>The Lotus Sutra is the king of sutras, true and correct in both word and principle. Its words are the ultimate reality, and this reality is the Mystic Law (myoho). It is called the Mystic Law because it reveals the principle of the mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment of life and all phenomena. That is why this sutra is the wisdom of all Buddhas.</string>
		<string>Whatever trouble occurs, regard it as no more than a dream, and think only of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>Nevertheless, I vowed to summon up a powerful and unconquerable desire for the salvation of all beings and never to falter in my efforts.</string>
		<string>I, Nichiren, have inscribed my life in sumi ink, so believe in the Gohonzon with your whole heart. The Buddha&apos;s will is the Lotus Sutra, but the soul of Nichiren is nothing other than Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.</string>
		<string>But after the pure Law is obscured and lost, the great pure Law of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the heart and core of the Lotus Sutra, will surely spread and be widely declared throughout the land of Jambudvipa — with its eighty thousand kingdoms, their eighty thousand rulers, and the ministers and people in the domain of each ruler — just as the name of Amida is now chanted by the mouths of the priests, nuns, laymen, and laywomen in Japan.</string>
		<string>Though a person may have been fortunate enough to be born as a human being and may have even entered the priesthood, if he fails to study the Buddha&apos;s teaching and to refute its slanderers but simply spends his time in idleness and chatter, then he is no better than an animal dressed in priestly robes.</string>
		<string>From a mundane view, I am the poorest person in Japan, but in the light of Buddhism, I am the wealthiest person in all Jambudvipa.</string>
		<string>Therefore, I say to you, my disciples, try practising as the Lotus Sutra teaches, exerting yourselves without begrudging your lives! Test the truth of Buddhism now!</string>
		<string>But those who follow the teachings of Nichiren honestly discard the mistaken doctrines of the provisional teachings and the incorrect theories of the mistaken teachers, and, with all sincerity, put their faith in the correct teaching and the correct doctrines of the correct teacher. Accordingly they are able to gain the lotus of the entity and to manifest the mystic principle of the entity of the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light. This is because they put their faith in the golden words of the Buddha indicated in the &quot;Life Span&quot; chapter of the essential teaching and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.</string>
		<string>If, knowing the best path, one sees one&apos;s parents or sovereign taking an evil path, can one fail to admonish them? If a fool, crazed with wine, is about to drink poison, can one, knowing this, not try to stop him? In the same way, if one understands the truth of the Buddhist teachings and knows the suffering of fire, blood, and swords, can one fail to lament at seeing someone to whom one owes a debt of gratitude about to fall into the evil paths?</string>
		<string>When great trouble occurs in the world, minor troubles become insignificant.</string>
		<string>Therefore, we know that the prayers offered by a practitioner of the Lotus Sutra will be answered just as an echo answers a sound, as a shadow follows a form, as the reflection of the moon appears in clear water, as a mirror collects dewdrops, as a magnet attracts iron, as amber attracts particles of dust, or as a clear mirror reflects the colour of an object.</string>
		<string>Where there is unseen virtue, there will be visible reward.</string>
		<string>Although at present we are encountering the severe trials of persecution, in our next life we will become Buddhas, Our present tribulations are like moxibustion; at the time, it is painful, but because it has beneficial after-effects, the pain is not really pain.</string>
		<string>Therefore, one should by all means persists in preaching the Lotus Sutra and causing them to hear it. Those who put their faith in it will surely attain Buddhahood, while those who slander it will establish a &apos;poison-drum relationship&apos; with it and will likewise attain Buddhahood.</string>
		<string>Although Nichiren and his followers are few, because they are different in body, but united in mind, they will definitely accomplish their great mission of widely propagating the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>What is most important is that, by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo alone, you can attain Buddhahood. It will no doubt depend on the strength of your faith. To have faith is the basis of Buddhism.</string>
		<string>It is clear that those who now believe in the Lotus Sutra will gather fortune from ten thousand miles away.</string>
		<string>Yet you must grit your teeth and never slacken in your faith.</string>
		<string>If we do not admonish the evil priests, how can we hope to do good?</string>
		<string>Though evils may be numerous, they cannot prevail over a single great truth.</string>
		<string>Likewise, the Contemplation on the Mind-Ground Sutra states: &quot;If you want to understand the causes that existed in the past, look at the results as they are manifested in the present. And if you want to understand what results will be manifested in the future, look at the causes that exist in the present.&quot;</string>
		<string>The same is true of prayer. Three things are required — a good teacher, a good believer, and a good teaching — before prayers can be effective and disasters banished from the land.</string>
		<string>Now, in the Latter Day of the Law, neither the Lotus Sutra nor the other sutras lead to enlightenment. Only Nam-myoho-renge-kyo can do so.</string>
		<string>The sutra states, &quot;After I have passed into extinction, [one] should accept and uphold this sutra. Such a person assuredly and without doubt will attain the Buddha way.&quot; Never doubt in the slightest.</string>
		<string>One must set aside all other affairs and devote one&apos;s attention to rebuking slander of the correct teaching.</string>
		<string>It is the nature of beasts to threaten the weak and fear the strong.</string>
		<string>That ordinary people born in the latter age can believe in the Lotus Sutra is due to the fact that the world of Buddhahood is present in the human world.</string>
		<string>Birds and crickets cry, but never shed tears. I, Nichiren, do not cry, but my tears flow ceaselessly. I shed my tears not for worldly affairs but solely for the sake of the Lotus Sutra. So, indeed, they must be tears of amrita.</string>
		<string>No matter how sincerely one believes in the Lotus Sutra, if one guilty of failing to rebuke slander of the Law, one will surely fall into hell, just as single crab leg will ruin a thousand pots of lacquer. This is the meaning of the passage in the sutra, &quot;Because the poison has penetrated deeply and their minds no longer functions as before.&quot;</string>
		<string>Others read the Lotus Sutra with their mouths alone, in word alone, but they do not read it with their hearts. And even if they read it with their hearts, they do not read it with their actions. It is reading the sutra with both one&apos;s body and mind that is truly praiseworthy!</string>
		<string>When one has the rare good fortune to be born a human being, and the further good fortune to encounter the teachings of Buddhism, how can one waste this opportunity?</string>
		<string>The great lantern that illuminates the long night of the sufferings of birth and death, the sharp sword that severs the fundamental darkness inherent in life, is none other than the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>The most important thing in practising the Buddhist teachings is to follow and uphold the Buddha&apos;s golden words, not the opinions of others.</string>
		<string>&quot;… Though devils and demons may come to tempt you, you must not allow yourself to be distracted. The heavenly devil hates the Buddha&apos;s Law, and the non-Buddhist believers resent the path of the Buddhist teachings. But you must be like the golden mountain that glitters more brightly when scraped by the wild boar, like the fire that burns higher when logs are added, or like the kalakula insect that grows bigger when the wind blows. If you follow such examples, then how can the outcome fail to be good?</string>
		<string>For one who summons up one&apos;s faith and chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with the profound insight that now is the last moment of one&apos;s life, the sutra proclaims: &quot;When the lives of these persons come to an end, they will be received into the hands of a thousand Buddhas, who will free them from all fear and keep them from falling into the evil paths of existence.&quot; How can we possibly hold back our tears at the inexpressible joy of knowing that not just one or two, not just one hundred or two hundred, but as many as thousand Buddhas will come to greet us with open arms!</string>
		<string>The Buddha and Devadatta are like a form and its shadow — in lifetime after lifetime, they are never separated.</string>
		<string>Each word and each character of the Lotus Sutra contains within it all the 69,384 characters that compose the sutra. To illustrate, one drop of the great ocean contains within it the waters of all the various rivers that flow into the ocean, and a single wish-granting jewel, though no bigger than a mustard seed, is capable of showering down the treasures that one could wish for with all the wish-granting jewels.</string>
		<string>The bodhisattvas and the heavenly and human beings called upon the enemies of the Lotus Sutra to appear, hoping that if they could fulfil the oath they had taken in the presence of the Buddha then Shakyamuni Buddha as well as Many Treasures and the other Buddhas and Thus Come Ones would understand that, faithful to the vow they had made before the Buddha, they would begrudge neither their reputations nor their lives in defence of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>As for the characters of the Lotus Sutra, a blind person cannot see them at all. A person with the eyes of a common mortal sees them as black in colour. Persons of the two vehicles see them as the void. Bodhisattvas see various different colours in them, while a person whose seeds of Buddhahood have reached full maturity sees them as Buddhas.</string>
		<string>The deeper the roots, the more luxuriant the branches. The farther the source, the longer the stream. All sutras other than the Lotus Sutra have shallow roots and short streams, while the Lotus Sutra has deep roots and a distant source.</string>
		<string>A woman who makes offerings to such a Gohonzon invites happiness in this life, and in the next, the Gohonzon will be with her and protect her always. Like a lantern in the dark, like a strong guide and porter on a treacherous mountain path, the Gohonzon will guard and protect you.</string>
		<string>To forget the original teacher who had brought one the water of wisdom from the great ocean of the Lotus Sutra and instead follow another would surely cause one to sink into the endless sufferings of birth and death.</string>
		<string>[T&apos;ien-t&apos;ai] likened the teachings of all the other sutras to streams and rivers, and the Lotus Sutra to the great ocean. He demonstrated that the waters that make up the Buddhist teachings of all the worlds of the ten directions flow, without the loss of a single drop, into that great ocean of the Lotus Sutra.</string>
		<string>To illustrate all stones are invariably inferior to gold, but gold itself is divided into several grades. No gold found in the human world can match the gold mined from the Jambu River. But the gold from the Jambu River is in turn far less valuable than the gold stored in the Brahma heaven. In the same way, all the Buddhist sutras are like gold, but some are finer and more profound than others.</string>
		<string>Encountering a good friend is the hardest possible thing to do. For this reason, the Buddha likened it to the rarity of a one-eyed turtle finding a floating log with a hollow in it the right size to hold him, or to the difficulty of trying to lower a thread from the Brahma heaven and pass it through the eye of a needle on the earth. Moreover, in this evil latter age, evil companions are more numerous than the dust particles that comprise the land, while good friends are fewer than the specks of dirt one can pile on a fingernail.</string>
		<string>Continue your practice without backsliding until the final moment of your life, and when that time comes, behold! When you climb the mountain of perfect enlightenment and gaze around you in all directions, then to your amazement you will see that the entire realm of phenomena is the Land of Tranquil Light.</string>
		<string>I, Nichiren, am the richest man in all of present-day Japan. I have dedicated my life to the Lotus Sutra, and my name will be handed down in ages to come.</string>
